#+Title: Human Thinking
* human event machine / thinking (reflection) about events (inner/outer) / AI
- personal vs. social intelligence
  - mutual enrichment of the personal and the social (growing language, growing tradition, growing brain)
    - i.e. our cultural evolution, what makes us human!
    - cultural evol. vs. natural one
- ONE CYCLE, ONE THOUGHT (sequential, concept of event machine from programing languages [PL] makes sense, i.e. node.js event loop): what do we do with it?
  - constructing coherent "picture" of the world we peceive
  - memory of coherent thoughts we do not doubt (how to we commit information to our memory? how is it encoded? Does Church encoding play a role?)
  - memory of thoughts we do doubt (plus: undecidable ones, anyway: non associative to valid facts collected)
    - makes our thinking slower by making us inclined to revalidate already established coherent facts (to keep our world view intact/coherent)
  - PANDORA'S BOX:
    - free -- but mechanical -- will of the human machine :: adding new ideas to our set of coherent thoughts / our valid personal record
    - some (un-)safety in big picture: random evolution on this planet, social intelligence, an ABIOGRAPHICAL record we miss most of the time
- the world of a host should be enough to life forms to flourish, proven by humans acting in my world with agents; how to do it with artificial agents?
