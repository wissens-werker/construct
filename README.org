#+BEGIN_SRC
(*) "mingle" is related to yin-yang-thinking of Daoism (yin:weak vs. yang:strong: women vs. men, cold vs. warm ...)

not only: Meat    and Mingle* ( the mingling of sexes and *MINIMAL* social/cultural reason:

                                BEWARE: asymmetric natural  physical (body)    strength !
                                         symmetric cultural psychic  (mind)    strength ?
                                           -> not   exploiting  the natural    strength
                                           -> nicht auszunutzen die natürliche Stärke    )

but also: Rinse   and Reason  (safety and alignment of body and society)

- alignment: meet yourself and meet ourselves finally
  - for Rinse you need energy, e.g.: pancakes (gluten), butter, (fruit-) sugar
  - for Reasoning on your own you need no sugar (even carbs have sugar)

  - for Reasoning about our society:
    ONE SHARED PLAN FOR THE WHOLE WORLD -> *MAXIMAZING*/optimizing social/cultural reason

* Gesellschaft in Ordnung und Muße? Society in order and leisure?
- body       -> mind                    -> cooperative reason   (construct, 1CA) -> society in order and leisure
- Körper     -> Geist                   -> Kooperative Vernunft (construct, 1CA) -> Gesellschaft in Ordnung und Muße
