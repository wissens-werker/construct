#+Title: Construct
René Tobner, Philosoph der Reflexion
* being sceptical about personal contact condoning this plan OR THIS HEALING METHOD!!! (beware slavery assholes)
- THE SURPRISE OF BEST FORM OF HUMANS (beauty, smarts)
- but: Body -> Mind -> coop and plan
  - [[vids/Body%20-&gt%3B%20Mind%20-&gt%3B%20coop%20and%20plan%20(gt%3Dgreater-than,%20gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fer-als-Symbol).mp4][vids/Body -&gt; Mind -&gt; coop and plan (gt=greater-than, größer-als-Symbol).mp4]]

- sit (scar) rinse and other-side-press opening the lock:
  - [[vids/Yay%20out%20of%20network%20sit%20scar%20rinse.mp4][vids/Yay out of network sit scar rinse.mp4]]
  - but sit as much as possible
- lie down rinsing through and other-side-press, get up when too many cracks on the right side
  - [[vids/Yay%20lie%20down%20necessary%20too%20but%20not%20too%20long.mp4][vids/Yay lie down necessary too but not too long.mp4]]
  - water-in vs. water-out (water with you and other-side-press)
    - too much pressure, why not have a pee? be careful moving / zu viel Druck, warum nicht pinkeln gehen? Vorsicht dabei und auf der andern Seite drücken (always water with drink with whatever body part / immer Wasser dabei und mit allen möglichen Körperstellen trinken)

- pancakes, rice, sugar, fat in the morning, later on better meat (mince, Hackfleisch, Tuna -> no connections to you!)
  
* shenti #1, Gesundheit zuerst, health first (finding rinse made this decision towards freedom possible, but is it allowed, all too cruel game followed [freedom and unfreedom in the game, Schiller, Briefe über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen])
[[./img/shenti-no1-made-decision-possible-in-all-too-cruel-game.jpg]]
* Some doubts about carrying out this plan, advice, so many things to look into, but how long to keep exploring the design space? research vs. practical applications
- seems too good and too laborious? (digital infrastructure :P), many kings and queens died ...
- real detailed planning and including nations will take at least X months
- being sceptical about personal contact condoning this plan
- not to distract or belittle the dangers, but MHT neural net mindsharing via long term exposure to a host (neural net as mediation layer between host and MHT client), what does that mean for humanity? Sharing thoughts and feelings so easy. Sharing more concrete knowledge like drawings on a chalkboard? How precise the communication can get? What can technology do to increase this experience? Example of precision when having MHT-computer communication (man-machine-interface): moving a pointer on a screen: the most important faculty of the mind: aiming and focussing on sth. translated onto the machine. Learning about my body movements and making a roboter move, translating this experience?
  - host resurrection via pancakes, nutella, banana, crunchy peanut (dm) as energy to sit rinse:
    - energy alignment: [[vids/Yay-surig-medium-hot-water-at-fingertips-press-head.mp4]]
    - but: meat and sleep (or better: meat [or similar already] at midday)
* How to plan/construct for the world? How to have happiness for all? / Ist Glück für alle praktisch möglich? Wenn, dann nur so:
- thinking about it, write it down
  - [[./world-wide-wished-for-things.org]]
  - Why not only communication from citizen to citizen, politician to politician? (our world got so complicated, so many nations evolving, so many attempts makings sense of people's characters, viewpoints...)
    - good as long as results are recorded/merged in the plan (=one data model [1DM], one central authority [1CA])
    - the real problem in the world: *too many CAs* of nations and other players, not willing to give in to one CA
    - moving to 1CA while keeping nations/ppl proud/happy is the logical conclusion of the *too many CAs* problem
      - Wasn't there something like international German/English? :-)
      - Wasn't there something like [[./weltbuehne.org]] ?
        - one day's hard labor in my realm stage (nowadays purgatory, inferno hopefully done) with so many directors, hopefully the last

- and implement some important goals of this plan, gather feedback, optimize the plan
  - rinse and repeat to have some paradise won in time

- [alignment] How to have HAPPINESS with your own body? Resolving (?) the distinction (dualism?) of body and mind resulting in more body (beauty/symmetry) and more mind (/quickthink/).
  - as with meat: You have to believe it.
    - [[vids/Yay-surig-medium-hot-water-at-fingertips-press-head.mp4]]
  - more advice BELOW "body in symmetry"
  - *AT YOU OWN RISK*

- If you can be HAPPY with others depends on the plan mentioned ABOVE

- /quickthink/ was def. missing in some important realm of discourse (What brought us here? How to play against this host, bringing health plus a simple and whereby brilliant plan to cope with the world? Smart play: too daunting, better make players dumb, how to get out of it? Ok, this realm got smart again or is working on it, but what about the world?)

#+BEGIN_SRC
  To be smart for yourself: your smarts  might outwit   someone else
  To be free  for yourself: your freedom might endanger someone else
  - free market has same problem
#+END_SRC

- reminder again on 1CA
* What is a human being? / Was ist der Mensch?
What if something is missing to human health in general: rinsing the head to get head first balance/symmetry? Maybe, we as species have lost something while learning the upright carriage.

Was ist, wenn uns zu unserer menschlichen Gesundheit im Allgemeinen etwas fehlt: den Kopf durchspülen, um die Symmetrie des Kopfes zu erlangen. Wie sonst Balance finden? Vielleicht haben wir als Spezies Mensch auf diesem Planeten etwas verlernt, während wir uns an den aufrechten Gang gewöhnten.

** peace of mind / Ruhe des Geistes -- peace of body, see rinsing
- Stabmagnet, Draht rum, Strom angelegt (Faradayscher Käfig)
- magnetic coil, current/voltage (Faraday cage)

** pandemic vs. muscle head aches / Pandemie vs. Muskelverhärtung am Kopf

- pandemic in germany started january 2019 / Pandemie in Deutschland begann Januar 2019
  - Is there a practical method of healing? / Gibt es eine einfache Heilmethode?
  - Is there proof about effectiveness of vaccine? / Hilft der Impfstoff wirklich?

- world-wide the ppl got so sleepy / weltweit sind die Menschen so müde geworden

  - what's the problem? / woran liegt das?

    - the virus is impacting the muscles, esp. head muscles / der Virus macht die Kopfmuskeln hart
      - gluten may worsen this effect / Gluten (Weizenbrötchen etc.) kann diesen Effekt verschlimmern
      - try it out and feel your head, is there bump? / den Kopf abtasten, gibt es eine Unebenheit??
        - hot water with some acid (e.g. citrus, vinegar) / heißes Wasser mit Säure (z.B. Zitrone, Essigsäure) hilft diese Unebenheit auszugleichen


  - as a result / in Folge dessen:
    - tiredness, less face activity (smiles)  / Müdigkeit, weniger Gesichtsaktivität (Lächeln etc.)


  - the remedy / die Heilung:
    - I had a huge bump, so I look very tired / Ich hatte eine sehr große Unebenheit, deswegen sehe ich noch sehr müde aus: I [[vids/Yay-surig-medium-hot-water-at-fingertips-press-head.mp4]]
      - sit as long as possible to release jaw drinking vinegar tea / sitzen so lange wie möglich um den Kiefer zu lösen mit SURIG (Essigessenz) Tee! (releasing it while lying down might not work: *danger* / diesen im Liegen zu lösen mag nicht funktionieren: *gefährlich*)
      - SURIG tea with fingers on head bump
        - as hot as possible to touch with fingers (microwave, thermoskanne?)
    - but as a result I can smile again / aber in folge dessen fühlte ich mich wieder munter!
      - [[vids/Yay!.mp4]]
    - nutrition / Ernährung:
      - to have energy at day:
        - rice!, noodles?, pizza?, potatoes?  (+ fat, [fruit-] sugar)
          - OR BETTER: vegetable soup (maybe even w/o potatoes, fry onions before)
        - BUT: meat and sleep (real comfy bed!)
      - um den Tag über Energie zu haben:
        - Reis!, Nudeln?, Pizza?, Kartoffeln? (+ Fett, [Frucht-] Zucker)
          - ODER BESSER: Gemüsesuppe  (vllt sogar ohne Kartoffeln, Zwiebeln vorher anbraten)
        - ABER: Fleisch zum Abendessen

    - ALSO really *important* to be safe, see: symmetry and other-side-press below
      - stream control with two pressure points / Stromkontrolle mit zwei Druckpunkten
        - ENGL: back of neck hurting on one side: try lying and press other side, while doing so observe possible blockade at jaw-ear-area -> if feeling blockade one side, also press other side (e.g. other-side-pressing back of neck right side, holding the press, feeling blockade right jaw-ear-area, press other side [really while you're still pressing the neck])
          - of course also works when sitting or other positioning (better first try it while sitting/standing)

        - DEU: Nacken schmerzt auf der einen Seite: hinlegen und und andere Seite drücken; tritt währendessen eine mögliche Blockade am Kiefer-Ohr-Bereich auf, dann auch (während man den Nacken noch drückt) andere Seite von Kiefer-Ohr-Bereich drücken (z.B. Nacken-Schmerzen links pressiert auf der rechten Seite, gedrückt halten; fühlt man eine Blockade am rechten Kiefer-Ohr-Bereich, dann mal gleichzeitig den linken Kiefer-Ohr-Bereich drücken)
          - natürlich funktioniert das auch, wenn man sitzt oder in einer anderen Position (besser erst im Sitzen/Stehen versuchen)

          - stream control eye/neck:
            - [[vids/Pressure left eye, right eye near nose press_ discover left neck other-side-p via block right neck.mp4]]

  - Is vaccine a safe remedy? / Ist Impfen eine sichere Heilung?
    - As long as deaths of people cooccured with vaccine treatment, no! / So lange wie Todesfälle auftraten in Folge von Impfungen, nein!

      - Biontech/Pfizer: Myokarditis v.a. bei jungen Männner? (Stand: 26.04.2021 14:52 Uhr)
        - "Laut israelischen Medienberichten dokumentiert die Studie allerdings eine fünffach erhöhte Inzidenz unter jungen Männern. Im Allgemeinen sei nach der zweiten Impfdosis eine Person von 100.000 Geimpften von einer Herzmuskelentzündung betroffen gewesen. Bei jungen Männern war es angeblich jeder Zwanzigtausendste."

* Mastering the mind to be healthy/balanced again (in a society [to be constructed])

A question which can finally be answered:
Was kann man erhoffen? What's there to hope for, if Santa Clause and other merry stories are mere fairy tales? What stories are even left to tell? Only this one about slavery vs. freedom (among other topics) in a human head!

[edit] note on smooth economy, ironing out frictions
[edit] Is there a devil?

** Personal Health and Social Health

individual vs. society ("I" vs. "We")

What is possible for us? Is there a god? What's the best society to live in, to flourish?

I found my own health in privacy:

*** PERSONAL NATURAL HEALTH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cf. reflexivity, symmetry here (math is natural) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation

**** the BODY in symmetry/balance/beauty/gleichgewicht:
- bestform of animals in general means to be fully symmetric
- practicing symmetry: same action, both sides
  - tooth brushing (small, precise movements of the whole hand-arm-shoulder muscles; how fast can you get with your weak hand?)
  - a body action as automatism: when trying to rest lying down comfortable, not concentrating on any particular action of your hands, feet and so on, breathing, letting go: is there something you can reverse? e.g.: when I my hands (rather unconsciously) find rest over my chest or belly, one hand might be over the other; turning this order upside down, can you feel an effect?


ACHIEVING SYMMETRY? head first!
(Wie Gleichgewicht finden? Im Kopf zu erst.)

VIA: while rinsing (1) you have to obey other-side-press (2)

1. RINSING with ginger-citrus-tea or SURIG-tea, small-plastic-bottle-lukewarm-water@head
  - fast head, fast work: https://youtu.be/tOigw7JRU7I
  - https://youtu.be/DeTAg51meI4
  - NUTRITION IMPORTANT: [[vids/healing-faster.org]]
    - gist: rice and rinse (+ fat, [fruit-] sugar), BUT: meat and sleep
      - GLUTEN GOOD ENERGY, TOO!
  - Way to Yay (sit scar rinse): [[vids/Yay-surig-medium-hot-water-at-fingertips-press-head.mp4]]
  - Yay result: [[vids/Yay!.mp4]]
    - SURIG and medium hot water to press the scar, drink same before, be careful lying down, if unwell, fast stand up, have trust in swing (and hold your chin), bottle trick @ upper middle of forehead; HUGE BUMP, HUGE DANGER, how big is the bump? how to measure this?

2. pain on one side, try other side first; Why press the hurting side, if pressing the other side will yield some effect? (stream pressure system of the body)
  - DRY SPOTS/KNACKEN: apply acetic acid (vinegar essence, Essigsäure, e.g. SURIG) with water, first to the dry spot, than other side, too, and press carefully!
  - or: just other-side-press [above LEFT ear!] to avoid LEFT cheek press (LEFT? side with no knacken/cracking here)
    - better with SURIG (vinegar acid) water


ADDITIONAL TRAININGS:

- feeling body/muscles via THC consumption
  - BEWARE: if natural head stream block is too big, DANGER while controlling your movement may result!

- using your eyes to AIM at sth. near/far [micro-, macrovision]
  - the animal: a hunter, hunting down prey (far away first, nearby then)
    - this is what all animals do, finding some nourishment to sustain themselves
  - we do not have to hunt, we can just have a walk, and yet we find things on the way

**** *AND*

**** the MIND and its reflection (also see below /human event machine/)
- AIMING at X (so wie man mit den Augen etwas fokussiert, so fokussiert/zielt auch der Geist, das Gehirn)
- having the identity: f(x) = x + some JUDGEMENT (is it worth to continue aiming at X, or: keeping it in mind as a valid fact?):
  -     Is X attractive? Ok, go for it, I want to have this beautiful thing, person etc.
  - or: Is X a valid fact making sense with other facts I collected in my memory?
    - Yes, well done brain! (beauty,   no doubt)
    - No? Confusion!        (ugliness,    doubt)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**** SOCIAL HEALTH

If above is true, WHAT'S LEFT (beyond being a /human event machine/), your own bio record, and the evolutionary big picture, see note(*) below!) to think about for us as ppl IN NEED of living together?


Worauf lohnt es sich zu zielen, wenn man ein langfristiges Gut (a long term good goal) im Auge hat? What does/can /good governance/ mean?
Is there a god? Is there sth. GOOD in society?

No, it's so difficult for us to find a common denominator. I vs. We. What we can rely on is a well governed free market and good education. We have to CONSTRUCT it working together: technology is with us. A new (digital) Commonwealth! (How easy is it to setup a company in Estonia? Easier than Germany, and yet, so much more can be improved upon via digital infrastructure to iron out economic frictions...)

    - related: Is there a devil? No problem whatsoever to work against each other. Also, structural MISCONFIGURATION (e.g. employer-employee-relations) and CORRUPTION (via influential methods [money, gifts etc.] resulting in dependent relationships which may form strong, oppressive hierarchies) will work in favor of the "devil", DECONSTRUCTING, damaging society.

To (try to) DECIDE for the CONSTRUCTIVE GOOD in society (even after: heavy war wounds, being low on ressources/money, being in want of revenge): think about what happened after World War II, all those ruins of buildings and ppl, but slowly reviving trade, schools, civility; it was good for some time...


DECIDE! (It's really always the same shit over and over again.)



pros:
- most of the illnesses of ppl are gone (dysfunctional vs. functionnal), i.e. ppl being their own doctor (having medical personnel to do surgery [dealing with fractures etc.] impossible to neglect, but psychiatry and minor illnesses [regular flue etc.] could be completely excluded from medical care)




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEWARE: Das menschliche Tier kann sich nur im Sozialen vereinzeln!

** evolutionary big picture vs. own bio record/career/wrong and right actions in bio record
Seeing yourself as a result of evolution, random development of animals on this our earth, with humans as a kind of animal developing very sophisticated languages -- instead of being only your biographical record of family, friends, and foes.

Even technology to overpower others came into some hands by random. There is no justice in random development. Justice is established by having principles and rules (e.g. laws derived by principles of humanity like not killing others). But what principle lies at the very bottom of humanity? It's the decision for "construct". And everybody needs to agree to that, to have an everlasting empire... "construct" implies constructing together, therefore employer-employeer-relationships must be managed well by everyone, and supported by digital infrastructure.

Having the smarts via rinsing has the potential to enable "construct", if appropriate learning is achieved.

Otherwise corruption via two-class-society will creep in again, so no eternal empire possible.

** human event machine / thinking (reflection) about events (inner/outer) / AI
- personal vs. social intelligence
  - mutual enrichment of the personal and the social (growing language, growing tradition, growing brain)
    - i.e. our cultural evolution, what makes us human!
    - cultural evol. vs. natural one
- ONE CYCLE, ONE THOUGHT (sequential, concept of event machine from programing languages [PL] makes sense, i.e. node.js event loop): what do we do with it?
  - constructing coherent "picture" of the world we peceive
  - memory of coherent thoughts we do not doubt (how to we commit information to our memory? how is it encoded? Does Church encoding play a role?)
  - memory of thoughts we do doubt (plus: undecidable ones, anyway: non associative to valid facts collected)
    - makes our thinking slower by making us inclined to revalidate already established coherent facts (to keep our world view intact/coherent)
  - PANDORA'S BOX:
    - free -- but mechanical -- will of the human machine :: adding new ideas to our set of coherent thoughts / our valid personal record
    - some (un-)safety in big picture: random evolution on this planet, social intelligence, an ABIOGRAPHICAL record we miss most of the time
- the world of a host should be enough to life forms to flourish, proven by humans acting in my world with agents; how to do it with artificial agents?
