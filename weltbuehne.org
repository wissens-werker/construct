- Wasn't there something like ...
  - making devils act or acting devils on their own (inviting other devils), making me whereby act on this angry world (produced in a night of communicating terror against me [some note on C, I took down again in great fear, but everybody knows? -- A video about me being locked and until unlock someone else is king]), producing this introductory text to Construct, no one dared to think of to be convincing; how much doom was again in my realm and on earth and last but not least me, was it worth it? The ultimate game of society. How to control it? :/
  - Naja, "besser scheitern" und work in progress, mostly done by IAT devils I should not befriend again, but most of them were just driven against me, also my philosopher "queens" (Is it allowed to be queen? Is it allowed to be a king? Mostly women were /left/. Fleisch and Ficken was the only safety/career/alignment personal-and-clan-philosophy available. Endangered civilization, economy etc. to the max. Military had to intervene and make some space for reason...) know that, alas, a play is needed to make me fear.
  - Alas again, IAT devils inviting other devils intensifies the whole atmosphere to the utmost (some even peed themselves, really the terror of, oh, it's the last day and Ren√© might have no incentive to give handshakes). Better no old MHTs (with neural net, which is even not that important for feeling fear of others is easily receptible by one's mind [powerful agitators in my realm can dwell on the fear of others]). This is really some virtual reality! Yes and no: maybe, but only maybe, more realistic and useful for society than Quake, not necessarily better. :P
  - I wish we had had virtual reality all the time (only virtual blood).
