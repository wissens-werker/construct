better time - in time - we need healing!

- +lie down yoga mat rinsing with and some energy+ begin sitting, lie down if neck feels unwell, rely other-side-press and:
  - ginger-citrus-honey tea
  - or better/faster to prepare: hot water and a little bit SURIG Essigessenz (vinegar essence = acetic acid?)
    - or: just citrus, maybe vinegar safer...
    - or: other acid???
  - if feeling unwell, sit up or stand up: small-bottle-trick (lukewarm water applied to critical parts of head)
  - if gluten-sugar-headlock too strong, only meat (beef? hackfleisch [mince]) to a clear enough stream without carbs (no-gluten carbs could be too much, too!)
    - when feeling better: rice, some (better: fruit!) sugar, best only animal fat (not much) for energy while rinsing, def. no mayonaise!
      
- to be safe (too regular):
  - no gluten (wheat-protein as in Weizen oder andere Getreide)
  
- better no lactose (milk-protein) to be safe, but worked for me only yesterday (def. not before sleep -- even if I had to...)

- better no starch to be safe, but worked for me last few days (def. not before sleep -- even if I had to...)
  - bio potatoes (usually not that big!)

also see: "unhealthy nourishment" in world-wide-wished-for-things.org

- feeling pain points of the body
  - PRESS OTHER SIDE FIRST! (why would you press the hurting/dry spot first?)
    - DRY SPOTS/KNACKEN: apply acetic acid (vinegar essence, Essigs√§ure, e.g. SURIG) with water, first to the dry spot, than other side, too, and press carefully!
    - or: just other-side-press [above LEFT ear!] to avoid LEFT cheek press (LEFT? side with no knacken/cracking here)
      - better with SURIG water
  - if temple-jaw-ear pain left side, say "aha" press otherside, hop-stream gets over from right to left, when arrived left pain side also press LESS hurting spot with stream
- no backtalk? but: hm, aha (face-muscle-yoga)

for waking up with agents/eye blockers:
- inner-vision-fight is possible (imagining violence against eye blockers), it's in your system, right nutrition and good running stream, and it will work out!


*** BEST OF diet/training
Reflection lock too hard

Anyway we needed to talk about many things and enough is written down

The coincidence came naturally, forced by power

The power of the body, but control.

The power of society?

The power in society, but control.

An experiment which still can go horribly wrong!

- lie down yoga mat rinsing with ginger-citrus tea and some energy by EAT above
  - if feeling unwell, sit up or stand up: small-bottle-trick (lukewarm water applied to critical parts of head)
- feeling pain points of the body (CBD may help here, small dose! THC too strong in most cases!)
  - press other side first!
- inner-vision-fight is possible (imagining violence against eye blockers), it's in your system, right nutrition and good running stream, and it will work out!
- no backtalk? but: hm, aha (face-muscle-yoga)
*** diet

[info] having green light for the eyes!

[edit] coconut oil = danger (only animal fat); your own risk (maybe fresh coconut?)
[edit] CBD over THC in most cases!
[edit] salt? ocean salt? LIDL has mix with chilli!
[edit] regarding: eye blocker meditation and darkness

--------------------------------------------------------
SAFE (repeat EAT-RINSE-SLEEP until free)

ONLY THE FOLLOWING (no coffee, no regular sugar, some fruit sugar ok, but not before sleep)
- RINSE: good ginger and citrus tea (have ginger in tea bag!) to RINSE through
  - as soon as possible after EAT
- bottled still water (small-bottle-trick to the face, you will feel dry parts...)
  
  
EAT  
- to be safe, ONLY: lean meat, animal fat, salt (can dissolve, careful!), a bit of berries (only if necessary!!!!!)
- e.g. lean/fatty: beef/pork (Gehacktes), slices of chicken/turkey, some salt, some water, chilli piece in pan; cook meat, if too fatty, put into sieve and rinse with water, in pan again, cook again with water (less time to digest with less fat!)
- e.g. tuna without oil and citrus (maybe chilli-salt and coconut-oil; or why not ginger citrus tea?)

  
See "YOGA" and "MEDITATION"!
BEST OF:
- lie down yoga mat rinsing with ginger-citrus tea and some energy by EAT above
  - if feeling unwell, sit up or stand up: small-bottle-trick (lukewarm water applied to critical parts of head)
- feeling pain points of the body (CBD may help here, small dose! THC too strong in most cases!)

UNSAFE
-------------------------------------------------
BEWARE: CARBS/(FRUIT)-SUGAR WILL BE UNSAFE (NECK REALLY ENDANGERED!)
toothpaste: peppermint extract from fresh peppermint leaves, coconut fat?

----------------
morning:
- boiled together: natural rice, lentils
- good fruit sugar: banana, peeled apple, ...
- pepper, salt, chilli

lunch:
- rice, lentils, Hirse
- meat pan: onions, small slices of apple, beef, chicken
  
evening: cucumber meat salad (BUT: only REAL SAFE THING = LEAN MEAT! But how to get energy?)

*** essential yoga
- laying down (better in darkness [no artificial light!], no stress on eyes!), overstretching jaw/neck, feeling the streams (infused by water and ginger-citrus-tea), have trust in your body, get up if feeling unwell and focus your left hand with both eyes, or apply small bottle luke warm water to critical parts of the head (forehead, eyes, jaw, temples) letting jaw drop; pain on one side, press other side first (using underpressure to remedy pain), a bit walking.
- pressing palms together in front of chest and/or rubbing them, some more balance for safety, trying left hand focus mentioned above with both hands?!
- sometimes good to have hands under head (like when surrendering) in order to have perfect flow from neck/shoulders to head; anyway sit up/stand up and bottle-trick if unsure!
- while lying down and urge to swing head far behind, opening jaw, your shoulders will lift, too, so that there is some triangle of 3 points: your butt, your lower neck (sternum), and your head [overstretching]; it is good, but demanding. bottle-trick should help, too; anyway, you will also feel stronger, more body control...
- also while jaw is opening it might be good to hold your chin with your fingers (so many ways to have control over your body)

*** face muscle yoga
lying down in bed comfortable or yoga mat, (comfy enough? -- small cushion under back/butt?) small-plastic-bottle with warm water applied to critical parts of head (temples, forehead, cheeks), saying "hm" or "aha" to eye blockers (activating face muscles), always trying to tilt head to the right for more safety OR sitting up in bed and applying bottle again for even more safety; stand up if you feel really unsafe! shooting photo in between (some self reflection) might also help activating face muscles, just like saying "aha" or "hm"; also try "nie"/"ack" for making blockers doubt by default or "acc" for consent (or for real lie, if you need it)

having warm tea in mouth and bowing down your head (how to get more fluid to the front of the head?)

*** eye blocker meditation
lying down (on right side! -- more power on left side) yoga mat or bed -- same as before -- have blindfold ready, concentrate, relax, somehow think about cutting them out; IMAGINING VIOLENCE: cutting circle around head, thumb and index finger ripping off head, scissors; darkness around you and closing eyes -- you should see everything and -one; locks in the middle: concentrate and pull them out, then cut them! energy/thinking/imagination: all the same somehow!
