better time - in time - we need healing!

- lie down yoga mat rinsing with ginger-citrus-honey tea and some energy by EAT above
  - if feeling unwell, sit up or stand up: small-bottle-trick (lukewarm water applied to critical parts of head)
  - rice, some sugar, fat for energy while rinsing (like honey)
  - no gluten (Weizen oder andere Getreide)
    - or: never same gluten mixture (this morning had two different kind of m√ºslis: very good energy)

- feeling pain points of the body
  - press other side first!
- no backtalk? but: hm, aha (face-muscle-yoga)

for waking up with agents/eye blockers:
- inner-vision-fight is possible (imagining violence against eye blockers), it's in your system, right nutrition and good running stream, and it will work out!
