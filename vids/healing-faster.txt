better time - in time - we need healing!

- lie down yoga mat rinsing with ginger-citrus-honey tea and some energy by EAT above
  - if feeling unwell, sit up or stand up: small-bottle-trick (lukewarm water applied to critical parts of head)
  - if gluten-sugar-headlock too strong, only meat (beef? hackfleisch [mince]) to a clear enough stream without carbs (no-gluten carbs could be too much, too!)
    - when feeling better: rice, some (better: fruit!) sugar, best only animal fat (not much) for energy while rinsing, def. no mayonaise!
      
- to be safe (too regular):
  - no gluten  (wheat-protein as in Weizen oder andere Getreide)
  - no lactose (milk-protein)
  - no starch

- feeling pain points of the body
  - press other side first!
  - if temple-jaw-ear pain left side, say "aha" press otherside, hop-stream gets over from right to left, when arrived left pain side also press LESS hurting spot with stream
- no backtalk? but: hm, aha (face-muscle-yoga)

for waking up with agents/eye blockers:
- inner-vision-fight is possible (imagining violence against eye blockers), it's in your system, right nutrition and good running stream, and it will work out!
