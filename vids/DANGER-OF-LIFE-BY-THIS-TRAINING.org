It's just acquired Bechterev or Rheumatism (the illness or rather a syn-drome of society [it just runs {drome} with {syn} or in society] because there seems to be no remedy -- one can only try to document various degrees of those illnesses), an imbalance accumulating at the head muscles. Hot to get rid of this imbalance (impacting the whole body)? Sit rinse and vinegar tea opens this acquired head lock. You will feel more of your body and accustomization takes time. So, yes take care!
