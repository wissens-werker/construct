** The Coincidence -- why the biggest thing on the planet Earth
- a philosopher finding principle of reflection
  - how I was informed by culture? modern prophecies: The Matrix
- a species developing rich language to communicate
- I to introspect
  - these 3 preconditions made possible among other things:
    - a game of reflection -- a mechanical game against (identity: commenting me; negation of idenity: threats with duals)
    - writing this work in progress together (R informing me about R, me coming up with Dante's marriage of heaven and hell)
    - thinking about society
    - huge repercussions in real world
      - but: the biggest thing on the planet
- that we are at this moment alive, w/o species going extinct is such luck
- that we found the coincidence (3 preconditions) also so unlikely
  - so we can imagine another planet the same thing happening? w/o it species very prone to go extinct (difficulty of communication, too much confusion, endgame scenarios, booom!)
    - yes, we can imagine radio tech to be developed therefore I, but...
    - so anyway, there were so many reasons to go crazy
** TODO Thinking about startgame - no easy feat

*** TODO war mongering / civil war / revenge should be abstained from FOR WHO KNOWS WHEN DESTRUCTION WILL END

- HITHERTO: pitting ppl against each other is just usual practice of the mighty (think: Göbbels)
- weapons of mass destruction could still be engaged
- it's still about the snippet regarding mastering the mind

*** TODO Mastering the mind to be healthy/balanced again (in a society [to be constructed])

[edit] note on smooth economy, ironing out frictions
[edit] Is there a devil?

individual vs. society ("I" vs. "We")

What is possible for us? Is there a god? What's the best society to live in, to flourish?

If this is true:

- the MIND and its reflexion (AIMING at X; having the identity: f(x) = x + some judgement:
                              Is X attractive? Is X a valid fact making sense with other facts I collected in my memory? Yes, well done brain!  No? Confusion! )
  
  - related: Is there a god? Is there sth. GOOD in society? No, it's so difficult for us to find a common denominator. I vs. We. What we can rely on is a well governed free market and good education. We have to CONSTRUCT it working together: technology is with us. A new (digital) Commonwealth! (How easy is it to setup a company in Estonia? Easier than Germany, and yet, so much more can be improved upon via digital infrastructure to iron out economic frictions...)

    - Is there a devil? No problem whatsoever to work against each other. Also, structural misconfiguration (e.g. employer-employee-relations) and corruption (via I etc.) will work in favor of the devil.

- to (try to) DECIDE for the CONSTRUCTIVE GOOD in society (even after: heavy war wounds, being low on ressources/money, being in want of revenge): think about what happened after World War II, all those ruins of buildings and ppl, but slowly reviving trade, schools, civility; it was good for some time...

  
THEN: decide. (It's really always the same shit over and over again.)

(*) Beware: Das menschliche Tier kann sich nur im Sozialen vereinzeln!

*** nothing2everything -- yesterday's we and Beckett's Waiting for Godot

the leash of the nothing
    making empires crumble in the end
    by being out of of tune
  
*VS*

the mutual everlasting binding of everything
    ending the wait
** The honor of the meat eaters (beef eaters): the last level of security
- but how to influence society? no, there was only this locking plan
- and by nutrition not much brain energy: just going with the flow: the locks of the R, the austerity of the world
  - and now: aligning via energy (rice, choco, apple) and rinsing and having security
- again: what a good novel!!! :/o)(
  
- btw: aligning is still difficult, I will not mention it again that you should try instead of playing me (and yes, I had my moment of shock today again, too much stream, difficult to control etc.)  
*** INFO Die ganzen Fleischesser vs. Feuchtigkeit in den Kopf
- erklären, dass für letzteres spezielle Sitz/Liege-Apparaturen entwickelt wurden, die jetzt durch das Spülen überflüssig erscheinen (weniger Hersteller), als ineffizient bezeichnet werden
** INFO Chrs... -- good notes about the constructive good
- was killed long ago? gluten lock inevitable used, driven crazy by Frau Geißler?!!!
- is with Thomas (the Jurist) and both are pretty happy
- came to Trier after Jan killed himself -- he was pressured into betting against me; my notes and pressure again made him crumble
- also had some hopes in me
- had no imminent hope in Cusanus' coincidentia oppositorum (rather in a far away future -- but every night a new world)
  - for the battle between good and bad just the regular way
  - but now some ppl believe alternative with good education is possible
  - some don't/didn't
  - but seems possible with following considerations:
    - the ultimate doubt of the Realm (safety/risk)
    - the already everlasting war between necessary evil and the constructive good (the constructive good not convincing enough, so that evil remains and be constructive in its own ways: "necessary")
    - end game/war scenarios because of dwindling ressources are UNCERTAIN regarding:
      - time of finish
      - how or if at all anyone will survive
      - how long can war play go?
        (just somehow related, I don't know how...: how long could my play go on?)
  - the constructive good is more convincing now with reflection theory and social insight about relationships
- had to kill Jan to get secret of rinsing and more info about my transformations (only related)
** TODO good fuckers vs. honoring women ("Ehrenkodex" Albrecht)
- PPL who don't care about reasonable writing: other locked up/trained in the R; interpersonal sex no matter how (esp. in KQ) vs. (Ver-)Ehrung für die Frau
- S: diese frechen Rotzbengel, die meisten werden halt so; hat sich keiner drum Gedanken gemacht, was da wirklich schief läuft
- both achievable, but possible for all? poverty, sex economy, education
- what is allowed to honor/what makes sense?
  - B's political split with S (communist ideas, not really in the know about the R)
  - B's family life with S
** TODO no one / our health / communication / y the devil IS/WAS so evil
With the first S-G actor/fighter in my realm! (I needed a reminder of the devil and the bloody fights necessary to keep me going and fend off the devils...)

youtube-dl was def. used and the network can share my content, videos had some impact

Diese ganzen unalignierten, unvernünftigen Männer (Frauen von der Straße klauen und Punsenclubs).
Die müssen ja eigentlich folgendes lernen: (damit die Frauen keine/weniger Angst mehr haben)
Frauen zuerst alignieren... haben auch schon viele getan, aber trotzdem noch zu gefährlich,, also Männer vernünftig machen..

It is autogenous training to be HEALTHY, i.e. having balance of body and mind, being fearless, standing at the edge of life, CONTROLLING it, not being drunk with power, staying socially reasonable.

HEALTHY women
No one wants to be not in CONTROL of his body. Birth control: my body, my choice. No anti baby pills for reduced body awareness and/therefore emotional imbalance.

(*) Beware: Das menschliche Tier kann sich nur im Sozialen vereinzeln!

*** my body, my choice -- completely at odds with some practices, businesses, trainings! Just reality.
Turning the world upside down by life's essence: sex drive.

No one wants to be called a cushion fucker for meaning: no one wants you, you are alone.
But we are social animals!
Sex/reproduction is an issue to tackle.(*)

(**) Does not imply selfsex. Body at core vs. sex at core. The first actually, if you look hard for it. In "civilization" we mostly see the latter (life w/o sex is quite meaningless, w/o joy).

** () -- Vereinbarkeit

M spielt bei mir (wohl eher seine Schauspieler! -- wer hat sich schon noch für mich interessiert, der Teufel so stark in Trier, ins Joch gezwungene Menschen überall), dann heile Welt bei sich; weil's ja auch wirklich recht gut klingt, wie ich mir den Frieden so vorstelle -- will ich ja auch.
Aber was ist hier alles in Trier und anderswo passiert?
Eigentlich egal, waren ja alle wichtigen Leute bei mir und ich weiß, was Konstruktion für die Gesellschaft bedeutet.
Aber dennoch zu viel ist passiert. Und Versicherungen gibt's wohl noch zuhauf.

Ich schreib was; die alte Welt, die Welt in mir, die neue...

Unsere Welt, die sich *entzweite*
durch:

das Spiel mit Influenz (und die Welt in mir, Faszination vernünftiger Mann...)
die Kraft des Körpers und Geistes (Durchspülen)
die Wut über das Unoptimierte (eine neue Welt wollend).
All die Toten, der Hass, die Feindseligkeit, die immer noch andauert.
Influenzer-Bandenkrieg in FF und vielen anderen Orten (München...)

*VS*

Meine ALTE Welt: Austausch und Leben in der R19: Genuß meist. Abgesehen von Verrrücktheiten (auch meinerseits) und Meinungsverschiedenheiten war es so verdammt frei, so umgänglich, so unbeschwert, dieses Leben: in der Küche sitzen, Sportzigarette, Tee, Kaffee, alle möglichen Leckereien, Musik, alle möglichen Themen,
(Trink-) Spiele wie Looping Louie, Munchkin, Poker...

Nur ich war noch nicht gesund genug dafür.

*VS*

Manche denken immer noch, dass Unterwerfungen gut für die Gesellschaft seien.

Und natürlich sind manche der Top-Spieler bei mir so verrückt geworden (die Automatismen im Spiel: mir möglichst schnell mit Bezug auf meinen Kontext Fragen zu stellen, die Identität zur Auslöschung wieder einspielen) -- Zettel mit Gedanken, die man vergessen sollte für das Spiel -- sonst hätte man zu viel verraten: mir oder dem andern Team. Diese Immersion. Wieder auftauchen...

*VS*

Vernunft, Vermittlung, Konstruktion
** TODO Gruppenbezogene Menschenfeindlichkeit
- ppl of color hard to come by in some circles (eastern ...)
** TODO PLAN -- CONSENSUS underway/Greek still good example of how bad economy can become
- support yes, but consensus no
  - blockchain with backdoor is wished for
- just to  remember in how many ways the earth might demise(?): https://www.appliedeschatology.com
  - comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25057288 :)
- with magic hat communication + thinking hub we have reached a new kind of age for humanity
- coordination for this new age seems to be in demand
  - for reliable coordination we need to have our arguments fixed, therefore safe info-hub in inet/darknet
- first adopters:
  - Collin Powell (former Bechterev, my technique helped so many)
  - Mr. Macron (citing Bank of France + Tezos as interesting cornerstone for a new digital commonwealth)
  - Ms. Merkel (former Bechterev)
  - Frankfurt a. Main + Oder
- any political group or politically minded person is of course welcome to contribute
- alles so gefährlich mit dem neuen Plan, Herr Trump über Koblenz, alle nur an mir interessiert, um mich mal zu ficken oder reinzureiten bis zum Tode; muss unbedingt sicher sein!
*** note on commonwealth
     = What's the name for our newly found perspective on the world? it's neither capitalism nor socialism (communism), but a true commonwealth we are able to aim at forever. It can be stable in a few months, if we work together on it with current technology used wisely. Btw: Reflection more basic than alignments symmetry. You obeyed power of natural alignment before, now natural thinking has unveiled itself by random (and we're damn lucky it happened at all! It may have been even lost in the Game...) once more in Reflection. Why not give nature a chance again? A new digital commonwealth for our new happy world! And soon hello-world-day/happy-world-day? :-) C'mon, what's the matter? Yes, soon game hopefully over, then experts can show you something you will really like!! It's not only me and Mr. Trauth going around with safe laptops... (but that's a good thing, too!)
*** TODO PUBLIC: world-wide wished for things
- in general: a functional state for functional citizens
- world-wide poltical agenda: native sustainable workers of a sustainable capitalistic economy, i.e. not going bankrupt every 10-20 years or so
  mixture of Amsterdam / Singapore / Luxemburg?
  
  1. ending Corona/Covid somehow for having employment/trade again flourishing
     - an alternative to austerity getting around the problem of lazy workers
       - more shifts, more ppl, more money: enough incentive for workers
     - supply chain and employment optimization via digital infrastructure managed by scientists, employers (and unions? = employees might do it themselves now)
       - maybe there even is some algorithm for optimizing all this?
       - machine learning
  2. investment into (via WTO etc.)
     - countries delivering workers to some other country (e.g. Poland to Germany)
  3. just go on as usual with foreign work force, but some betterment of salary for all
     - workers who feel the urge to return in their home countries should have enough incentive to do so (by 1.)
  4. refugees/oppressed -- for too much pressure on Europe
     - strong countries need to give some more freedom to weaker ones
       - nationstates for Palestines and Kurds
         - Israel and Turkey can arrange for that in due time
       - end of war esp. in Syria, Yemen via additional troups (more investment in United Nations army, NATO needs to be more neutral)
         - Mr. Assad is capable I think
         - Yemen as neutral as possible (w/o Saudi-Arabia having too much to say)
       - other peoples under distress
         - ex-Jugoslavia: maybe reunion possible?
         - Krim? should be ok to stay with Russia!
  5. digital infrastructure
     - blockchain for the world to inspect and control economic differences of the nations and to finally have some good grasp on managing volatility of markets
       - no problem for legal economy, but (crime) activities of e.g. prostitution (unfree) cannot be erased easily
         - still reliable numbers would be great
         - sth. which can only be begotten by powerful rule?!
     - fiber/5G
     - ...
  6. the end of all philosophy: ultimate wisdom reached: possibility to empower humans with reasonable thinking in every aspect (What is god? Who is our creator?)
     ? to have real functional humans:
     - knowledge about reflection (e.g. human event machine, no god) => quick think w/o doubts
       - empowering thinking and body via natural means and a culture of cooperation (modernity) vs. oppressing body and thought via artificial means (tradition)
         - privacy is necessary for mastery of body, full capacity of the mind
           - can ppl stay reasonable? the decision vs. feelings of revenge
     ! but also real free? (may detect I -- depends on level of alignment)
       - frequency jamming
       - magic hat police necessary yet
**** INFO public infrastructure vs. private business / both necessary
- freedom of browsers vs. monetization
  - via ads (adblockers pain in the ass for enterprises promoting some product)
  - media -> drm? (digital rights management)
- Mr. Stallmann, Mr. Torvalds vs. many entrepreneurs
  - all the licences
  - to find a way for the free market
It's better when it's free. Regarding sex def., but still ppl want to have a product to sell...
private vs. public tools production [economy/Ökonomie]
**** INFO functionally employing ppl vs. automatization/robotics (pretty much [far] away future)
- slave workers vs. functional workers by reason (how much laziness is an issue?)
  - GDR was trying to solve worker question via I enslavement and it worked, but wasn't enough, state bureaucracy already at the brink of collapse (employing so many officers)
  - also influencers found by inspection of consciousness that trust in socialism ("diese Bonzen") was subpar
- what can be known to general public:
  - more shifts, more ppl in work, 12 EUR proposal (in Germany by SPD) as minimum wage already means a lot, but with more shifts and less hours it's very probably not enough
  - time employment agencies really do not help
    - flexible employment of workers without temp agencies?
- what is behind the scenes:
  - we need a means to exchange goods
    - money with inner worth : Bitcoin
    - fiat money (since gold standard was abandoned -- Bretton Woods):
      - any regular national currency on this planet
      - creation ex nihilo since Bretton Woods ever more
    - the play about the money must continue to have day to day trust in our future / to sustain ourselves with goods (Waren: Haus, Auto, Lebensmittel)
- good parenting should be possible
  - time for children in the evening, maybe not every evening for late time shopping should be possible
  - automatization should solve this in the future, but how much automatization do we want?
    - In the end as much as possible I surmise.
    - There should be enough interactions with ppl besides shopping ones left, we cannot yet imagine this, but more robotics will come.
**** INFO slave businesses: conversion of investment is recommended and incentivized
conversion of those businesses (like money extortion, prostitution) is recommended and is INCENTIVIZED by the plan in order to rule out slave businesses in general and lifting some grudges (just too much new thinking I brought)
- benign slavery: personal slaves/servants in your own household/estate is OK
  - private sex slavery is not recommended but OK for tradition is trained this way!
- some more reasons:
  - just my personal opinion: why would I like this, if me and my wife were endangered by this practice?
  - adjustment to all this new stuff I brought is just so difficult
  - older generations is maybe too much used to this sex business and private usage of slaves
  - we really need some time to implement the plan, so it's good to keep everyone satisfied, even if we do not like this practice
  - in time reason will prevail and it's somewhat unclear when for so many ppl are involved...
    - self-sex already had some impact on prostitution activity which left some business owners quite unhappy
**** TODO unemployment management / guarding against poverty / smooth economy
- banks have a duty to uphold real econmy (among other things)
  - bitcoin may be a gold standard (it is by technical means and also by ppl having trust in it, but will others allow it?), but distribution of wealth and stability might be at odds sometimes
- parity with employed workers regarding Christmas bonus (end-of-year bonus)
- auf der Schwelle zum neuen Jahr, Konjunktur ankurbeln (to reflate the markte at the doorstep to the new year) [saumseelig with Mr. Schulz]
- Why Zeitarbeitsfirmen if unemployment agency can deal with it?
***** WORKING HOURS
****** example
- ALDI had a poll extending opening times LIDL-like (until 22pm) and ALDI workers denied this (stayed with 20pm)
- Another solution might be more working shifts.
**** TODO reform health system world-wide / as efficient as possible
- Rinsing/Durchspülen already standard...
- my body, my choice -- completely at odds with prostitution (free or unfree), abortion denial (Poland)
- this should explain betterment of ppl
- get rid of COBOL (an about 61 year old PL)?
  - https://logicmag.io/care/built-to-last/
    - "IBM’s latest, fastest “Z” series of mainframes have COBOL support as a key feature"
  - COBOLs reads pretty much like natural language, BUT STILL:
    - HOW MANY MANAGERS (NON-PROGRAMMERS) HAVE A LOOK AT COBOL CODE?
    - issues of code correctness, way less type safety
  - transpiling if necessary... (i.e. Haskell DSL to COBOL)
- making functional ppl w/o exposing alignment and awakening in privacy
- aligning by dancing (cf. China, Wuhan experiment)
- coffee shops in order to be able to lear about your body in privacy (being your own doctor)
***** INFO China proud again (Wuhan: so much progress)
- some medical experts needed to be shutdown (eolIFE or bad media) for hoax continue
  - Spiegel could manage w/o eol! :-)
***** RÜCKFRAGE How much cancer is related to psychic condition? (being fearful about becoming ill?)
- natural relegion helps to eradicte this fear completely
**** TODO e-government / efficient bureaucracy
- really easy to create a company (cf. England's SME [small-medium-enterprises], Germany's Ich-AG)
  - easier paperwork
  - having skilled ppl (England: north-south-gap)
  - cf. theconversation.com SME bedrock british econommy, gov.uk Local Industrial Strategies (2018)
**** @WORK more (green) energy
***** solar power from Africa or even souther Europe
- Australia is delivering sun energy to Singapore by 2027 (Sun Cable)
  - direct current submarine cable tech
- too much political trouble in Norther Africa right now, but South Europe?
- Sub-Sahara (Kenia, Namibia?) has even better sun power than Northern Africa
  - some sun panels already there, but lacking infrastructure (bringing it to the ppl)
***** progess with fusion reactors?
- arirang.com
***** hydrogen energy for factories and trucks / not that good for (personal) cars?
**** @WORK economic kybernetics/supply chain optimization with free market of course
es muss immer IRGENDWAS ausgehandelt werden in den einzelnen Märkten, in Staaten, in Unternehmen (Lohn, Arbeitszeiten, value of a currency)
Sachen, die nicht ausgehandelt werden müssen:
Urlaub (ja der Staat macht das einfach! gesetzl. Regelungen..)

Schritt für Schritt Abstimmung in diesen Märkten / Tezos Blockchain und die Protokollaushandlung
EIN NETZ VON NETZEN / einzelne Unternehmen bis hin zur globalen Weltwirtschaft
jeder ist irgendwo Teil eines Netzes
die einzelnen Netzen versuchen von zentraler Stelle aus zu optimieren, aber Verhandlungen auch innerhalb der einzelnen Netze
Firmen haben Macht über ihre eigene Verwaltung (Blockchain etc. in Firma, daher schwierig dort jetzt auch überall Tezos zu etablieren) -- Zahlen aber zur Wirtschaftskontrolle nach außen liefern..
Öffentliche Hand sollte aber mal alles mit Tezos machen ; hier die Aushandlung zwischen Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer perfekt machen (als Demonstration auch für die freie Wirtschaft)
Aushandlung sollte abgebildet werden in der Datenstruktur; andernfalls eine systemische Schwäche, die uns spätestens seit der Industrialisierung zu schaffen macht (Arbeitgeber overpowering Arbeitnehmer until Arbeitnehmer storm the factory, and rinse and repeat)
Wir können einfach nicht diesen Fehler immer wieder machen, so viele Neutrale/Unparteiische, die dieses Problem sehen. Und wie überhaupt nochmal neu anfangen, wenn nicht mit der richtigen Architektur...
Politik gibt's ja auch noch für die Unternehmen... Wirtschaftsregulation

irgendwie muss Leistung belohnt werden ;
Meritokratie und Technokratie hand in hand

***** to have ONE OPEN SOURCE PRODUCT ready for markets in companies and state economy planning? covering all the use cases?
***** TODO each country having control over its currencie's value
- to only rely on Bitcoin/btc is too much?!
- currently Europe's Euro model just sharpens economic imbalances between member states, for weak economic power of one country cannot be balanced by decreasing one state's own currency value
  - maybe it still makes sense to keep Euro, for each country euro country managed on blockchain weights can be applied???
    - also some trust in each countrie's currency? and still only digital? printing money and minting coins too much of a hassle?!
    - still getting rid of paper money like in Singapore and China seems to be worthwhile
    - a common ledger -- different currencies to level differences in economic power
- some experts to consult: Yannis Varoufakis, Alexis Tsipras, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Giorgos Papandreou (Athens), James Galbraith (Texas)
  - A modest proposal for solving the Eurozone Crisis, Version 4.0
***** Internet of things @ blockchain + 5G fast everywhere could be really helpful
- huge quarrel between USA and China
  - mostly about market share?
  - but also espionage (more open source could help here) or only red herring argument?
- can't we have 5g open source infrastructure (have to look up what's it about)
  - China/Huawei is already principal planner in ITU (Internat. Telecomm. Union)
***** TODO consensus algorithms
- having a copy of sth. uniquely produced, those receiving the copy can make consensus
- cf. zero knowledge proof
***** ethereum
***** tezos
***** business management for everyone; connection to blockchain
- SAP: more blockchain in Enterprise-Resource-Planning for the plan
  - makes really sense with this huge market share!!!
- open source candidate?
***** more local production to avoid mono cultures, having more organic food
- maybe more ppl like to work in agriculture again?
- happy farmers
- less feeding the world
- how much meat is necessary? still (organic) meat nice to have!
***** cardano?!
***** Kantorovich/linear programming
- https://chris-said.io/2016/05/11/optimizing-things-in-the-ussr/
- There are hierarchical levels to the "economy" and central planning may work well at some levels. Companies at the lower levels of the hiearchy are centrally planned entities with managers assigning tasks to employees instead of using a free market to distribute them within the organization. At the middle layer, the free market links these centrally planned companies and force them to compete. It's an open question whether having a centrally planned top layer to handle national economic strategy and steer market forces is better than letting the free market handle that as well.
***** TODO linear types and prototype objects
- on a blockchain
- dynamic and type-safe programming?!
  - linear types for efficient memory allocation!!!!
  - for mixins in OO?!
- dashes, greater-than in function names (works with QWERTY, too! :-) )
- a concatenative language is a functional one and trivial to run efficiently

**** education
***** digital classroom
- HPI Schul-cloud
**** @WORK clash of cultures vs. integration of cultures / cultural religions vs. one natural religion
- natural big picture (evolution) vs. cultural big picture (natural religion, reasonable politics)
- not easy to make integration happen with all the different emerged aspects of cultural life, among these religion is a major obstruction for integration
- journals mocking religions might be either
  - a useful act of criticism exposing defects of religions as in:
    - preachers of hate boosting inter-religious, inter-cultural war ideas ("we are the oppressed, we need to defend, so please go to training camp in middle east and learn to fight!")
    - rather unreflected sex education in the light of 21st century/secularization/gender thinking)
  - really making the sitation worse and hardening the frontiers as in
    - Charlie Hebdo bombing, thereupon worlds stands united with "civilization/reason", but still neglecting integration
- but the real problem are cultural religions themselves for they rely on:
  - some prophet X and his interpreters making up rules for all
- so, is there a natural religion we all could consent to?
  - yes, we only need to know about the origin of our species and abstract (get rid) whereby of all cultural distinctions
  - this is possible by thinking about our:
    - random evolution on this planet
    - evolved social intelligence as opposed to only personal intelligence (what you know is just trained into you by society, but still you very much know your own history. Just both would be important to have this natural religion.)
    - What's in your mind anyway?
      - if there is nothing to be afraid of in your mind nor to hope for (no devil/no god), what's actually going on in the mind, what can we rely on? Just reflecting the world and building concepts in our mind in order to have an effect on the world, to survive, to reproduce, to engage with others, to learn words from others to share them again with others, to build communities, to destroy others, i.e. to mediate, to fight... and now we are here in the 21st century. big picture of evolution vs. personal biography of family, friends, foes
      - to see that you're nothing else than an animal which has with other animals developed interesting words to speak about (social intelligence instead of this rather personal notion we acquire)
      - personal intelligence emerges out of social intelligence/communication (flintstone making fire, something really interesting to talk about?!)
      - to find out about the cultivation of intelligence happens exactly one time on any planet in the universe exhibiting life forms (assuming the life forms will not go extinct by some interior/exterior misfortune [war/meteor-shower])

**** TODO pension planning:
    - why necessary to have ppl plan so much for themselves about retirement? Why can't the state effectively provide this service?
    - better family structures to provide for elderly?
      - might be difficult but retirement homes are quite a horror most of the time...
        - family schemes of Italy might be a good example here?!
**** TODO reforming law
- just new law written in English
- too much: Grammatical Framework / Raanta
  - have one abstract formulation for a law and have multiple representations in different languages all abiding this abstract one
  - a programming language (PL) to describe natural language(s) to have a precise formulation which can be used at court
  - this PL based on lambda calculus and is dependently typed, which means it's very expressive and consitency of laws is machine checkable
  - there really some effort to encode all this (also for the different nat. languages), but the key point is still to have consistency (hopefully less lawyers / law bureaucracy needed to manage laws)
    
    
**** WAT?! rule out crime by reason and I
- by reason: no more violent action because of relationship envy
  - Affekthandlung = emotional act
  - Totschlag = homicide
- by I: inspection of suspects like usual
- sex in prisons via selfsex; had to be forced and after some time it worked for some; this group could convince other inmates?! less testosteron, way more relaxed prison life?! no stressing out other inmates to have sex with you!
**** TODO sexual education
***** exploring privacy (selfsex, awareness of the body, automatic healing by satisfaction [food, THC, music, sex, sleep, symmetric training])
- many mighty ppl think it should be a secret!
- meine tausend kleinen Tode und wieder mal ein großer Tod bereitet, ja naja... war wohl nix!
- der Natur wieder zu vertrauen, was kann das heißen?
  - sich selbst vertrauen können, weil man seinen Sexualtrieb unter Kontrolle hat!
- Geheimnis der Gesundheit
  - informing ppl about this health practice might be too hard to grasp
    - RECOMMENDED to wait for concerted effort (school, textbooks etc.)
- Was ist der Mensch? Was ist die Intelligenz eines Menschen?
  - Intelligenz vs. Wissen? [Event-Machine]
- linke Hand vor Gesicht fokussieren, etwas zum Zielen haben, linke Hand Aktivierung per Fokus stärkt linke Seite; zum Ausbalancieren ausgezeichnet
- We are so tightly bound by our social context, that it's really hard to find one's self.
  - to alleviate/mitigate/ease (ger. /lindern/) relationship-stress (you might experience) being alone at least once in your life is advised
  - to be really independent from other persons and interpersonal sex drive (once in your life at least)
    - for we are so much entangled in our day to day culture, confusing words, confusing opinions, it is so hard to be really alone
  - concentrate on your health, your own nature only
  - achieve relaxed best form of body and mind (mind = only reflection as attraction or detraction to concepts you have internalized)
  - being more relaxed in any kind of relationship, be it just for pleasure or parenting
- We are so tightly bound by confusing concepts, that it's really hard to find one's self.
  - Does god exists? If not or unlikely, what remains of all this misery?
****** feeling your body / autogenic training
- feeling pain and pressing the other side
****** evolutionary big picture (social intelligence) vs. your own life
- TODO cf. MoB
- seeing oneself as a result of evolution, random development of animals on earth with humans as a kind of animal developing very sophisticated languages, instead of being only your biographical record of family, friends, and foes
  - Isn't this redemption for free?
  - Is this enough to deal with bad conscience? E.g. murder?
- how did humanity and its intelligence evolve on this planet?
  - just communication about interesting phaenomena, e.g. the first man made fire using a flintstone replicating the fire cast by thunderbolt on some dry wood (maybe even your own humble hud?)
  - but still a flintstone able to reproduce the power of nature
  - i.e. something interesting to talk about
  - interesting first words to speak about
  - our intelligence/knowledge is just the result of social interaction (knowledge not communicated is lost knowledge)
****** social principle
- TODO cf.

***** sexual preference by training / one may assume metrosexuality as norm
[edit] natural standard (hetero) vs. cultural standard (metro)
- sexual preference is established by being trained in social context
  - being gay or lesbian is just by training
  - experience about this training related by the queer community
  - shaming plays big role when ppl are trained on each other
    - peer pressure about having first intercourse leads to finding a mate as fast as possible ("Did you already pop the cherry?")
      - first intercourse with cousins or even among siblings also not uncommon
        
  - hetero sexuality seems to be the NATURAL STANDARD (there are exceptions like having neutral or both sexes in members of a species?)
  - the CULTURAL STANDARD should be metrosexuality for if you know sex preference is by random and trained, why not decide for yourself whom to fuck!
    
  - metrosexuality is the new standard perspective regarding gender preference! metrosexuality = metropolitan sexuality = in big cities more freedom of choice regarding preference of gender of your sexual partners developed first, so just for the lack of a better term for this behaviour, "metrosexuality" still applies universally, although we know the term itself referencing only big/capital cities is plainly wrong (relying on etymology for explaining specific terms might be daunting...)
  - standard of metrosexuality does not imply paedophilia (endangering the free will of the child is a bad practice, again endangering future relationships of the child TODO)
***** RÜCKFRAGE gender differences
****** female
- clitoris :: The antomist Mateo Renaldo Colombo (1516-1559), professor at Padua, claimed to have discovered it ("/De re anatomica/",[unsic!] 1559, p. 243). He called it /amor Venris, vel dulcedo/ "the love or sweetness of Venus.[sic?!]" It had been know earlier to women. (That's just another claim, of horse! :-) )
***** INFO gender equality
- <2020-12-07 Mo> dream about christmas-sugar-testing (☑) and trouser-testing (no checkmark), regarding the last I was preferring close-to-skin trousers althoug I said earlier that this is too much to observe in general for sex drive is just so difficult to overlook
  - still in the context of being with my wife in a club/cafe meeting with friends I just don't know
  - but in professional context (at work like on a spaceship) how much sexiness can you endure and still be faithful to your spouse? Are Star Trek's dresses too sexy to be professional? I don't know.
  - Should I tell her what to dress for some given social context X. I don't know. Rather not.
  - Women think a lot about this as well as men, some times less, some times more...
  - gist: How much exertion of control over the loved object/person is necessary? As few as possible, in order to preserve freedom. (maybe it's possible to express uneasiness about choice of dress, just some expression of doubting, thinking, envy (somewhat positive envy: as a token of you being bound to your mate via attraction, what can of course exploited by others, the fear of your mate being lured into unfaithfulness; this is just hard to get rid off with an attractive mate...)
***** WAT?! Onanism / self-sex
It should be ok to explore you're own sexuality with appropriate tools for various reasons:
- feeling unattractive
  - how to feel attractive w/o having sex? Having sex usually makes you "sexier"! (but also bad experience possible which result in just opposite -- still bodily activity (like any kind of sport) should result more attractivity
    - but: body/mind problem and experiencing sex
    - if privacy established only positive experience should remain, because you're very reassured of your self
      - circular reasoning to onanism again
  - having sex usually makes one more attractive because you're body is activated to the utmost [cf. runner's high]

- pressure of first intercourse (which sometimes might be even marriage)
  - women and loosing their virginity: Is clit-rubbing ok esp. before first intercourse? (Thanks for this direct question!)
    -> If it is ok for men to dash one's doodle, why not the analogue practice for women?

- men masturbating
  - Getting blind masturbating seems very unlikely, however it might be bad for alignment, if you do it only with one hand always. You should train both hands!
  - for the perfect simulation of sex:
    - to have moldable material (some kind of thick blanket) to produce a comfortable hole to fuck into,
    - using a condome -- to not hurt the penis.

Nonetheless, the human being can only really find oneself in the social realm. Without social contact, what includes sexual intercourse, we never would have survived in the first place.

more reasons for self sex
- really independent from other persons, interpersonal sex drive (once in your life at least)
  - for we are so much entangled in our day to day culture, confusing words, confusing opinions, it is so hard to be really alone
- concentrate on your health, your own nature only
- achieve relaxed best form of body and mind (mind = only reflection as attraction or detraction to concepts you have internalized)
- being more relaxed in any kind of relationship, be it just for pleasure or parenting
- solution to burden of interpersonal shaming because of having interpersonal sex or not is one instance of group based human hatred (hatred and shaming are very much related)
- why force anyone to have sex with you if you can do it and (potentially) enjoy it way more -> ruling out paedophilia (endangering the freedom (biographical free will) of the child)
***** sexual perversions
****** paedophilia
- paedophilia in families = incest
- literally: kin-lying
- examples showing how hard it is to refrain from sexual contact, esp. when you're already so close to someone as in family relations, also dissatisfaction with actual partner plays a major role:
  - parents break up (one possibly moves out), one of the parents trys to console child might end in sexual activity (why not with his partner, i.e. wife/husband ?)
  - (step-)fathers engaging with children (why not with his partner, i.e. wife/husband ?)
- to avoid: having stable partnerships, also:
  - self-sex (cushion-condom, dildo): why force anyone to have sex with you if you can do it and (potentially) enjoy it way more -> ruling out paedophilia (endangering the freedom (biographical free will) of the child)
****** abuse when succumbing
- an ordinary thing in the Realm for power as I is not to be exposed
- hard to get rid off, but again self-sex might soften this practice
**** DONE +problem+: exposing alignment to make clear symmetry is important
- but, how to introduce Theory of Everything / getting some groups into the boat / aligning religion and physics?
  - lambda the ultimate
  - w/o exposing alignment of the body?
    - not speaking about body symmetry, but reflection is possible
    - reflection as:
      - identity (mirror, eyes, identity-function)
        - finding identity, religion?
      - principle of physics for example
**** DONE unnecessary: immunization (w/o) agents AND covid test should be implemented as soon as possible
- unnecessary for rinsing if allowed
- my proposal SEEMS to acceptable by all parties, is practical in the current situation
  - also my viewpoint vs. Hobbes' is really something worth considering (Hobbes' humans need to be subdued by Leviathan, cannot be made completely reasonable in greater societies [how to deal with crowds of ppl in 18th century London?]

How to get out of Covid/Corona and have time to plan new society?

- we have a narrow market syndrom by lockdown/Covid
- we need to regain economic stability by getting rid of Covid somehow
  for:
  - worst case: civilized ppl transform into the "mob" ever more by economic insecurity
  - regular case: everyone somewhat unhappy (less money and/or no work) and unsure about future development

- therefore I wish to have as soon as possible
  - medical testing for Covid (which turns out negative)
  AND
  - vaccine with agents cannot really be disallowed for
    some level of control is requested!
    - but: in Germany almost noone will take the agent-vaccine? (concerns: what about long term studies? Is it really safe? blablabla...)
    - can it be forced? rather not?!

IN ORDER TO FINALLY END COVID

- maybe we can even save Christmas?
  (even ppl travelling to their families will be seen as a risk under Covid-lock)
- Christmas 2020 was fucked up already, so Sylvester/New Year should be happy already!
- <2021-01-07 Do> still waiting...
*** TODO +PUBLIC+: world-wide wished for things (w/o I)
- federated and limitless, what's this union we have on earth? Be it the german, the european, or the union of the whole world? There has to be a chance for reason, or not? One data model, one plan, one new world!
  
  - Otherwise Covid will never end, I dare say! Please forward to others!

- föderiert und grenzenlos, was ist das nur für eine Union in der wir leben? Sei es nun die deutsche, die europäische oder die der gesamten Welt? Es muss eine Chance für die Vernunft in dieser Welt geben, oder nicht? Ein Text, ein Plan, eine neue Welt!

  - Corona wird sonst nie enden befürchte ich! Bitte weiter senden!
  
- in general: a functioning state for functioning citizens
- world-wide poltical agenda: native sustainable workers of a sustainable capitalistic economy, i.e. not going bankrupt every 10-20 years or so
  mixture of Amsterdam / Singapore / Luxemburg?
  1. ending Corona/Covid somehow for having employment/trade again flourishing
     - an alternative to austerity getting around the problem of lazy workers
       - more shifts, more ppl, more money: enough incentive for workers
       - capitalistic logic, i.e. always more profit, even doubted by capitalists themselves after exposed to my theories and practical tips

  2. investment into (via WTO etc.)
     - countries delivering workers to some other country (e.g. Poland to Germany)
  3. just go on as usual with foreign work force, but some betterment of salary for all
     - workers who feel the urge to return in their home countries should have enough incentive to do so (by 1.)
  4. refugees/oppressed -- for too much pressure on Europe
     - strong countries need to give some more freedom to weaker ones
       - nationstates for Palestines and Kurds
         - Israel and Turkey can arrange for that in due time
       - [@todo] end of war esp. in Syria, Yemen via additional troups (more investment in United Nations army, NATO needs to be more neutral)
         - Mr. Assad is capable I think
         - Yemen as neutral as possible (w/o Saudi-Arabia having too much to say)
       - other peoples under distress
         - ex-Jugoslavia: maybe reunion possible?
         - Krim? should be ok to stay with Russia!

    - issues of code correctness, way less type safety
  - transpiling if necessary... (i.e. Haskell DSL to COBOL)

es muss immer IRGENDWAS ausgehandelt werden in den einzelnen Märkten, in Staaten, in Unternehmen (Lohn, Arbeitszeiten, value of a currency)
Sachen, die nicht ausgehandelt werden müssen:

Schritt für Schritt Abstimmung in diesen Märkten / Tezos Blockchain und die Protokollaushandlung
EIN NETZ VON NETZEN / einzelne Unternehmen bis hin zur globalen Weltwirtschaft

Öffentliche Hand sollte aber mal alles mit Tezos machen ; hier die Aushandlung zwischen Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer perfekt machen (als Demonstration auch für die freie Wirtschaft)
Aushandlung sollte abgebildet werden in der Datenstruktur; andernfalls eine systemische Schwäche, die uns spätestens seit der Industrialisierung zu schaffen macht (Arbeitgeber overpowering Arbeitnehmer until Arbeitnehmer storm the factory, and rinse and repeat)
Wir können einfach nicht diesen Fehler immer wieder machen, so viele Neutrale/Unparteiische, die dieses Problem sehen. Und wie überhaupt nochmal neu anfangen, wenn nicht mit der richtigen Architektur...
Politik gibt's ja auch noch für die Unternehmen... Wirtschaftsregulation

***** to have ONE OPEN SOURCE PRODUCT ready for markets in companies and state economy planning? covering all the use cases?
- good deed judgements by the network (build trust, sth. to show off?, like in ebay: good customer/seller)
***** TODO each country having control over its currencie's value
- currently Europe's Euro model just sharpens economic imbalances between member states, for weak economic power of one country cannot be balanced by decreasing one state's own currency value
  - maybe it still makes sense to keep Euro, for each country euro country managed on blockchain weights can be applied???
    - also some trust in each countrie's currency? and still only digital? printing money and minting coins too much of a hassle?!

***** Kantorovich/linear programming
- https://chris-said.io/.../11/optimizing-things-in-the-ussr/
- There are hierarchical levels to the "economy" and central planning may work well at some levels. Companies at the lower levels of the hiearchy are centrally planned entities with managers assigning tasks to employees instead of using a free market to distribute them within the organization. At the middle layer, the free market links these centrally planned companies and force them to compete. It's an open question whether having a centrally planned top layer to handle national economic strategy and steer market forces is better than letting the free market handle that as well.

** Das Rätsel der neutralen Union
Was kann unsere gemeinsame Gegenwart sein? Wie kann sie sein? Gemeinsame Nenner...

René Char / Erste Mühle / Gemeinsame Gegenwart

Es drängt dich zu schreiben
Als ob du mit dem Leben im Rückstand wärst
Wenn es so ist dann geh deinen Quellen nach
Eile dich
Eile dich weiterzugehen
Was dein ist an Wunder Wohltun und Rebellion

Wirklich du bist mit dem Leben im Rückstand
Dem unsäglichen Leben
Dem einzigen schließlich dem du dich vereinen magst
Das dir von Menschen und Dingen täglich verweigert wird
Von dem du mühsam hier und dar ein paar magere Bruchstücke findest
Nach unerbittlichen Kämpfen
Sonst aber ist alles nur unterwürfige Agonie grober Zweck
Triffst du den Tod indes du dein Feld bestellst
So empfang ihn wie der feuchte Nacken das trockene Schweißtuch begrüßt
Willig dich beugend
Möchtest du lachen
So biete deine Ergebenheit an
Nie deine Waffen
Du bist für außergewöhliche Augenblicke geschaffen
Wandle dich zieh dich klaglos zurück
Wie immer die sanfte Härte dich leitet
Weiter geht Stück für Stück der Totalausverkauf der Welt
Ununterbrochen
Unbeirrt

Streue den Staub nur aus
Keiner je enträtselt daß ihr eins seid.

- there is a video of him and other Pythons about the merits of religion and shortly discussing onanism
- What do intelligence officer (think: an endangered /spy/ in a foreign cold war country etc.) do? They cannot be really safe with a person prostituting her/himself. In order to relax they need some good method to have an orgams (they could be killed while or after having sex with a rather unknown person to them), cushion-condom-selfsex is just so practical here for males. Dildos setup firmly at wall/bed to have it doggy style for females.
  - how can soldiers even work? And having weekly or so visit to a prostitute, how much calmness/focus to do their job is gained here vs. doing it multiple times just alone.
- Of course having a (loving/caring?) partner to have sex with is just the regular thing  for social animals like humans; but what is the perfect simulation of sex with a partner when for some time being you cannot rely on one? Or no one is attracted to you...
- despite having a funny term like /to doodle dash/ for onanism, other terms like /to jerk off/ have a negative connotation for there is a social stereotype about not doing it alone and also one might just feel alone for that /seems/ to be a fact. Anyway THC and feeling the body is some remedy and being alone with your body is diving into nature. 
  The essence of /privacy/ is about what to find when seemingly being alone, feeling the body, healing. You are not alone, you have so much help from your body. Shenti#1 (health first).

- the dualism of I and We (individual freedom vs. freedom in society)
  - also per example of having agents in me representing the whole earth, again yes, to find it in the body again: nature, culture, nature, culture, nature... life reproducing itself via swarm thinking and thinking together (me having some thoughts the others think logically valid [also with respect to their historical record of events perceived in the human event machine], SO they can add another thought to it, I am able to agree to, writing it down.

A past full of illusion about the human being. And to see the big picture was too bright for all of us. I also was very much afraid about the issue of free will, which is no longer a problem in light of the human event machine. So, how was it about breaking vicous circles?

  - what can he do with his POWER? his knowledge? -- just succumb the next girl
  - can he ever be reasonable?
  - maybe there is no cure, not even with privacy
  - Wolfgang had to arrange the King's Quest -- he almost got free, but was caught again by personal contact

**** TODO civilization vs. wolf honor / doves vs. hawks -- doves shall have chance, but does it work w/o the hawks? just a next generation thing?
    - a new way: a civilization for eternity, some heads cannot accustom
    - he is just too much a danger, was a risk to get him back to his former masters, to show his head around, that a new civilized way is around, also that women can be safe in Frankfurt again (even if prostitution is around), to CONTAIN SADISM with his throat slit (or other means), I HAVE CONSIDERED. Now, Wolfgang as well as others consider dwelling in randomness to see happy faces again instead of short term pleasure, which was so cruel to my beloved queen. To give other devils than Wolfgang some relief by making Wolfgang a scapegoat and kill him is not helpful for the devils in general. Also Lisa likes to kill each and every one who violated her, why not? But waste of human ressources. Einer für alle is not enough, all is enough, but that's hardly feasible, so better no one.
      
      Now still prostitution too ingrained in society. I hope for sth. better. Only civilized men and women? Is this possible? Maybe one day! Women should be save and honored, why to exploit someone weaker than you. Is this power? You feel the power, yes, but it's just too easy, no challenge! How to be strong? All this fighting for ressource (sex, money, ...?). To optimize ressource distribution in society is the challenge for humanity on this planet right now. We have the technology to do it.
      
      To be a wolf, to be cunning, have women, have status symbols, that's the current honor of the Realm. How can Wolfgang live w/o these privileges. Also the pack needs a scape goat now. Lisa some revenge. A greeting from the wolf pack, WOLFGANG'S HEAD, the honor of the wolves: Wolfgang agrees to! We have convened about his death, and it is just true, it's not only my decision, it is just the current way of the Realm; nothing can make it change so fast, just crazy, too dove like, even for a dove, my position. So respect to the wolves and some revenge for Lisa. An honor for Wolfgang!

    - it's still a hidden war in the I community, and the cannibals will not give up sadistic priviliges easily; threats must be answered seriously, some heads will be in the way, some more throats will be slit; ein Exempel musste statuiert werden mit Wolfgang, ein Sündenbock geopfert, a way for FF society to feel better

Nur die Gewissheit der eigenen Verletzbarkeit und die Verletzbarkeit des andern. -- Man will aber stark sein! Wie kann der andere aber gleichzeitig stark sein? Es hilft nur die neutrale Sichtweise der psychischen Gesundheit (siehe oben), die uns die Verwirrung der vielen Wörter und der vielen Personen, die uns nah oder fern stehen, nimmt. Diese Leere ist irgendwie angenehm, so wie weißes Papier, weder gut noch schlecht. Keine Zweifel mehr.

- or just being succumbed by a witch and let free for being more capable w/o headlock (Mark Zuckerberg)
- some lords from city X which also have their masters (some scar) are just satisfied to have their business in drugs, prostitution (ready to use for the middle man, too), deliver some part of the money made to their masters (so much money in prostitution)

Die menschliche Würde soll irgendwann unantastbar sein -- und das ist sehr, sehr schwer.
Human dignity was in perspective with base law (Grundgesetz) of Germany after second World War, put forward by USA, UK, France and others; then developments in GDR rendered all these noble effors useless.
Now health, balance, symmetry, beauty by sit scar rinse alignment even for heavy injuries.
And having having the body balanced a lot is possible, especially with the right philosophy of the mind (just reflection) and this decision for "construct".
Körper -> Geist -> Kooperative Vernunft (construct) -> Gesellschaft in Ordnung und Muße
satisfaction (Zufriedenheit in Balance) -> reason (Vernunft: ihr wisst vielleicht von Reflexion, aber Symmetrie WAR nicht so leicht zu erlangen) -> und was dann, wenn ihr dann zufrieden seid? Wollt ihr nicht mit anderen ZUFRIEDENEN Menschen zusammen leben?

Menschen, mit den man ZUFRIEDEN sein kann, müssen ohne Korruption sein. Sonst beginnt irgendwann die selbe Scheiße wieder von vorne: Austerität = Sparpolitik = schlechte Laune/bad mood, und jeder meckert, entweder, weil er weiß, dass das die Normalität ist, oder weil es ihm oder ihr wirklich schlecht geht, finanziell vor allem.

Dieses Zusammenleben ist nicht einfach, aber es ist jetzt möglich mit Symmetrie, Reflexion und der Entscheidung für "construct", d.h. die Zusammenarbeit ohne Korruption. Wie zufrieden die Menschen ohne Symmetrie sind, das variiert; wie effektiv sie sind, wie produktiv, das ist absolut invariabel: man denkt schneller mit Symmetrie, man arbeitet schneller mit Symmetrie. More shifts, more ppl in work. Mehr Schichten, mehr Leute in Arbeit -- möglichst alle! Und Arbeiter-Arbeitgeber-Beziehungen besser regeln mit digitaler Infrastruktur, sowie das auch besser in den Staat integrieren (Steuern etc.). Das nenne ich: einen funktionalen Staat für funktionale Menschen.


** love and reflection (something to worth aiming at)
love as attraction
hate as detraction (one can be attracted to hate, but only to get rid of it, you do not want something or someone you hate around you all the time, right?)

being attracted to beauty
being detracted from ugliness
gaining the attracted thing may result in some kind of satisfaction (burp, orgasm, a new thought)
men stronger => women easier to control => prostitution with women normal, but right? We've come a long way towards civilization, but still a lot left...

more duals possible here
but always attraction and detraction behind
guiding our aiming
aiming at X = reflecting upon X = thinking about X
the mind is about reflection
what to doubt = somewhat ugly
what to not doubt = somewhat beautiful
the beauty of understanding how we understand, less confusing words by finding duals
the mind is about reflection
- eine neutrale Sichtweise/Aspekt, die von Gut und Böse (z.B.) absieht/abstrahiert
- a neutral view, which does not care about e.g. good and bad
- yin - the female (physically/körperlich more weak); yang - the male (physically/körperlich more strong);; how to deal with it? most ppl think absolute symmetry is too much, maybe only because it's so new, well, and reason WAS hard to come by.
  
Relationships are often prone to various grievances, since we might too heavily rely on other persons -- especially in matters of love. Inherently other persons are not under one's own control, still we feel the urge towards other persons for various reasons. In love, of course, the distance between love and hate is just the greatest, and always switching between these far apart poles (being in love vs. hating because of envy e.g.) might tear us apart.

Not controlling, but...

I'm wondering if we can find here a general pattern in regard to the capacity of the mind, namely: Is it not always the case, when we think, that we are attracted or detracted to either some perceived thing of the outer world or a concept of the mind (roughly: word of natural language), so in the end thinking is just attraction or detraction, which is an reflected action, or just reflection, which is apparent in natural sciences, too. (For example: The double-slit experiment where a reflecting observer changes the outcome of the experiment.)

Maybe here is something to think about, to have not that a rough distinction between human and natural sciences?
** doubting nothing

It is possible for me by still keeping a clear mind, having no doubt about eventual alignment, for alignment, which is symmetry, is just derived from reflection, for reflection (giving back the identity just like the reflection in a mirror) is simpler than symmetry, adds something to reflection. So again, just by thinking clear with my event machine, which is all the time reflecting/thinking objects of the world (no matter if it's the outer world from my eyes or my inner thoughts) by having them reflected in my mind, -- I have a simple fixpoint which allows me to doubt nothing.

- dass war einfach zu lächerlich, wie ich hier in Trier für mich dahingelebt und gelernt habe, wann kriegt er denn jetzt mal eine ab? aber nein, irgendwie zu wählerisch.
  - keiner kam ja an mich ran, weder körperlich, noch per I (Platte zu dick auf dem Kopf)
  - na und wie aligniert wäre ich dann gewesen? dieses Alleinsein, was mir ja eingebläut und eingelebt wurde (durch I und Eltern), das war's ja immer noch nicht, ich musste noch viel einsamer werden und fand dabei meinen Körper und meinen Geist, sowie die Gesundheit beider
  - Körper hat sich alleine geheilt auch mit THC, Aktivierung des autonomen Nervensystems + Ingwer-Zitrus-Tee (eigentlich auch mit Honig)
  - [TODO] im Geiste musste ich dabei meinen EINSAMEN? Lebensweg begutachten
    - dennoch mehr, nämlich dieses Wundern über die Aktivität des Körpers und wie das mit den Schmerzen ist, die man verspürt, ohne absolute Alignierung -- lieber nicht die schmerzende Stelle drücken, sondern zunächst am besten die gegenüberliegende Seite; damit wird trotzdem auf der schmerzenden Seite mehr Strömung durchgeleitet, welche die Blockade, den Schmerz, die A-Symmetrie mehr oder weniger schnell behebt
    - wenn das Wiederherstellen von Symmetrie dann eine so große Rolle spielt für die Gesundung des Körpers, was ist dann mit der Gesundheit des Geistes?
    - naja, der Geist reflektiert einfach über die Gedanken, die ihm gerade kommen
      - nicht über bestimmte Sachen reflektieren zu wollen, die A-Reflexion, vergrößert das Unterbewusstsein, erhöht einen versteckten Zweifel
      - clearing the mind:
        - kathartische Emotionen beim Reflektieren über unangenehme Gedanken: Wut, Weinen

** WAT?! training and sexual preference in society (some make it, some don't / run for mates)
- health/power of women:
  - women can feel their body again better with selfsex and w/o taking "their" pill, many really have discovered the joy of sex since like never before (of course it was possible to have enough exposure to sex before, but how many men were necessary for this, and was the woman in case respectable???? )
  - many women got used to faking orgasms, but this is mostly a thing of the past, for if you can enjoy your own body via selfsex, why wouldn't you expect it with your partner?
- health/power of men:
  - impossible w/o sexual activity
  - in youth being attracted to women more or less early (just to cover the dominant perspective of heteros, which seems to concur with sex preference of mammals [and others animals?] in nature)
  - some make it to the women and have good experience, can go on like this
  - some don't make it and feel insecure compared to the successful men
    - IF you don't make it, well... :
      - former times: just inadequate/unpractical methods (even pocket pussy is not enough)
      - modern times: selfsex via cushion and condom as perfect simulation of sex with a partner (remember the term pillow humping? look up pillow humping and see what porn will show up, and really doing it w/o condome will probably hurt you...)
    - OR ELSE
      - you may consider your mate to be of the same sex as you (the homo erotic case)
        - being gay is one possible outcome of this /run for mates/, in earlier times the probability of this outcome was very low, for the taboo about gayness was strictly punished in society; nowadays metropolitan life increased the likelihood
        - as of today, ppl "opting" in to being gay, cannot easily get out of this training (and if you KNOW, your preference is trained in /run for mates/, you ARE able to decide whom to have pleasure with [standard of metrosexuality])
        - the human being vs. the animals
        - rich language vs. rudimentary language (Erdmännchen e.g.)
        - cultur vs. nature
        - not only reproduction, cultural pleasure vs. surviving
          - our life is not only about reproducing offsprings, it should be a pleasure with whom you have sex
        - using our hands to build things vs. using your claws to get meat in case you're a carnivore
          
      - [perversities] even more possibilities here which also involve cruelty to get sex, endangering the free will of partner(s), and usually produce legal repercussions
        
  - also like with animals in nature: can they make it to their females and satisfy their own nature? = life's trick on us to produce new life (the animal kingdom vs. our human kingdom: we made up tricks to cheat on nature by contraceptives (condoms, the pill etc.) anyway
    - to have selfsex an optimized cheat, in turn the world changing so much, so unexpected for me, having only my health in mind, finally finding time in this ever more fast paced times with so much communication / we had to think about all of this anyway, one time this planet!

But we want reason and satisfaction for each and every one.
Die menschliche Würde soll irgendwann unantastbar sein -- das wär' doch mal was oder?
*** prostitution
Now still prostitution too ingrained in society. I hope for sth. better. Only civilized men and women? Is this possible? Maybe one day! Women should be save and honored, why to exploit someone weaker than you. Is this power? You feel the power, yes, but it's just too easy, no challenge! How to be strong? All this fighting for ressource (sex, money, ...?). To optimize ressource distribution in society is the challenge for humanity on this planet right now. We have the technology to do it.
** MY CURRENT DIET and TRAINING (finding balance so easy rinsing through and underpressure: BIGGEST FIND!!!! and "(a)ha" to eye blockers and the bottle@head and inner-vision-agent-kick)
- was online for about a day for the Realm to think about it
- doesn't really make sense to have it online all the time:
  - again saving others might endanger myself
  - slavery is still dominant in Germany, America and elsewhere
  - has been already copied a lot
  - my ppl will be careful whom to convey this knowledge
  - IT'S ABOUT THE PLAN, implementing better economy and education
    
    
  - BUT PPL NEED TO BE SAFE and this recipe is sold on (black) MARKET already for HIGH PRICE
  - [edit] is too much for some! (Wolfgang coming free, safety from his masters, many masters left)
  - [edit] HAVE recipe in FB: minimal freedom!
*** Bring economy online again! End corona! Be safe!
*** more small bottle trick
- lukewarm water via microwave with a bit of citrus
- even if you feel safe while rinsing, sit/stand up apply bottle to right side over ear AND left side (left side may be even more important)
- walk in between and eat Tuna w/o sunflower oil or beef Hackfleisch for stability!
- spoon citrus also for stability/body esp. control
*** TO RINSE THROUGH
tap water for ginger-citrus-tea (Leitunswasser ok, evtl. Wasser filtern!)

small bottle mit stillem, lauwarmem  Wasser + Zitrone auch gut (Wasser vom Supermarkt evtl. besser, aber siehe oben)

fast eat-digest-rinse-pee cycle: (really fast: without carbs!)
pee sitting, rely: other-side press (first) and small-bottle

beef-Gehacktes chicken-pieces (most) - rice (some, natural: not white!) - cucumber (more)

Meersalz und Chilli :-)

**** BEST OF diet/training

- lie down yoga mat rinsing with ginger-citrus tea and some energy by EAT above
  - if feeling unwell, sit up or stand up: small-bottle-trick (lukewarm water applied to critical parts of head)
- feeling pain points of the body (CBD may help here, small dose! THC too strong in most cases!)
  - press other side first!
- inner-vision-fight is possible (imagining violence against eye blockers), it's in your system, right nutrition and good running stream, and it will work out!
- no backtalk? but: hm, aha (face-muscle-yoga)
**** diet

[edit] regarding: eye blocker meditation and darkness

--------------------------------------------------------
SAFE (repeat EAT-RINSE-SLEEP until free)

ONLY THE FOLLOWING (no coffee, no regular sugar, some fruit sugar ok, but not before sleep)
- RINSE: good ginger and citrus tea (have ginger in tea bag!) to RINSE through
  - as soon as possible after EAT
- bottled still water (small-bottle-trick to the face, you will feel dry parts...)
  
  
EAT  
- to be safe, ONLY: lean meat, animal fat, salt (can dissolve, careful!), a bit of berries (only if necessary!!!!!)
- e.g. lean/fatty: beef/pork (Gehacktes), slices of chicken/turkey, some salt, some water, chilli piece in pan; cook meat, if too fatty, put into sieve and rinse with water, in pan again, cook again with water (less time to digest with less fat!)
- e.g. tuna without oil and citrus (maybe chilli-salt and coconut-oil; or why not ginger citrus tea?)

**** essential yoga
- laying down (better in darkness [no artificial light!], no stress on eyes!), overstretching jaw/neck, feeling the streams (infused by water and ginger-citrus-tea), have trust in your body, get up if feeling unwell and focus your left hand with both eyes, or apply small bottle luke warm water to critical parts of the head (forehead, eyes, jaw, temples) letting jaw drop; pain on one side, press other side first (using underpressure to remedy pain), a bit walking.
- pressing palms together in front of chest and/or rubbing them, some more balance for safety, trying left hand focus mentioned above with both hands?!
- sometimes good to have hands under head (like when surrendering) in order to have perfect flow from neck/shoulders to head; anyway sit up/stand up and bottle-trick if unsure!
- while lying down and urge to swing head far behind, opening jaw, your shoulders will lift, too, so that there is some triangle of 3 points: your butt, your lower neck (sternum), and your head [overstretching]; it is good, but demanding. bottle-trick should help, too; anyway, you will also feel stronger, more body control...
- also while jaw is opening it might be good to hold your chin with your fingers (so many ways to have control over your body)

**** face muscle yoga
lying down in bed comfortable or yoga mat, (comfy enough? -- small cushion under back/butt?) small-plastic-bottle with warm water applied to critical parts of head (temples, forehead, cheeks), saying "hm" or "aha" to eye blockers (activating face muscles), always trying to tilt head to the right for more safety OR sitting up in bed and applying bottle again for even more safety; stand up if you feel really unsafe! shooting photo in between (some self reflection) might also help activating face muscles, just like saying "aha" or "hm"; also try "nie"/"ack" for making blockers doubt by default or "acc" for consent (or for real lie, if you need it)

lying down (on right side! -- more power on left side) yoga mat or bed -- same as before -- have blindfold ready, concentrate, relax, somehow think about cutting them out; IMAGINING VIOLENCE: cutting circle around head, thumb and index finger ripping off head, scissors; darkness around you and closing eyes -- you should see everything and -one; locks in the middle: concentrate and pull them out, then cut them! energy/thinking/imagination: all the same somehow!
** Anxiety when smoking weed? This may help:
- but to be acquainted with your own bodie's nature and feel a natural headlock (streams not running smoothly around your head) it's just the best (testing your health by activating the energy produced by your belly by THC -- really small doses!!!!)
- the mind only an event machine doubting or not doubting things (and have this saved in your memory) -- so there's nothing to fear about your mind, and gods or devils or whatever!
  - CBD to calm down
** WAITING Neutral governance and sex ed
[think] maybe this whole practice, more sth. for terminal ill ppl -- I was def. so out of life!
[edit] "some equality", instead of "number one"
[edit] made edit about instability of long term relationships if more than two partners involved, see below; but still polyamory, why not?

Same, same, but different for some have really learned a thing or two:

No socialism
Free market
Some neutral* governance

*As opposed to just "good" governance for example in education:

Did you ever wonder why learning in schools is so boring OR so demanding OR so without merit for your future career?

It is because old education could not tell you about life's essence as reflection as in:
- the light by sun or candle making it possible to have the reflection of some object X in your eyes
- the reflections of your mind: words, images, feelings
- reflections in nature: physics: the double slit experiment

I don't know that much about natural sciences. My philosophical insight is just that reflection seems to be such an important concept, that scientists around the world can reorder our knowledge, in order to make education easier to grok. (And by the way, enough of them already died for this cause.)

Also, all the discussions about gender equality can be finally brought to an end. The ridiculous thing is that it's about selfsex:
- pretty normal for women to use a dildo or similar to be satisfied (or why is this produced by industry?)
- pretty un-normal for men for:
  - #1 to have a women handy is just possible for men (even by means of violence)
  - #2 to have a practical method for selfsex was unheard of until someone came up with the idea of fucking into a soft cushion using a condome (artificial vaginas, like pocket pussies, were already pointing in the right direction, but again see #1) 

Now, the idea would be that satisfaction in a relationship is more easy, if partners(**) explored their own sexual satisfaction via selfsex.
(**)  might be even more than 2, but more unstable for more expectations to fulfill and may not help long term relationships, i.e. marriage
Overdominant sex drive in society just kills society (harassment, envy, murder, so much labor for law and police).
But selfsex can solve this issue by controlling your own sex drive.
This is SOME equality of man and women to consider in a reasonable society: to admit the possibility of selfsex for both sexes in order to get aquainted with your own body/nature. And there is more than just orgasms here, it's the whole domain of autogenous training! (privacy is more than selfsex)

Of course having a (loving/caring) partner to have sex with is just the regular thing for social animals like humans, but how satisfying is it to be in a relationship, how long do you need to find someone matching "your" expectations? (mostly women's perspective, TODO: more men's perspective? already covered via "having a women handy"?!)

Doktorspiele
women know earlier, teasing boy (kindergarden, school) [pussy whiping]
- boys should know more earlier, too (kindl. Frühaufklärung)

- E. Cummings: romantic ideals vs. being control of sex ed
how much romantic can you uphold in your relationship, if society around makes it hard via education and the results thereof?

CONSENTED BY ENOUGH: This is to be common knowledge, working society impossible w/o it. The salient point: to deal with the messy world and its almost imperceptible wrongs doings to human nature.
- jews and the Beschneidung; Abstumpfung vs. feeling the body = some mutilation, why? better feeling, feeling better (if pain spots removed...)]
  - they can fuck longer, good for women, too!
  - but is it really good for the man? @Mark Z: one just gets used to it!
  - regarding getting used to sth.: individualism, what can that mean to the extreme? privacy; theory vs. practice :/

The biggest experiment in world history: war and peace inside a human being, manufacturing consent with the ideal of neutrality in mind (gender equality, what can that mean?)

So hard to make progress with new insights regarding most important force in nature: reproduction. WE had to fake it in the play (somehow when time) to get an idea, what we are talking about, still so hard implementing it. The real world vs. the plan! But: CONSENTED BY ENOUGH!
  
*** not really helpful  
Bonus: too much! maybe worth telling it, but printing?
- What do intelligence officer (think: an endangered /spy/ in a foreign cold war country etc.) do? They cannot be really safe with a person prostituting her/himself. In order to relax they need some good method to have an orgams (they could be killed while or after having sex with a rather unknown person to them), cushion-condom-selfsex is just so practical here for males. Dildos setup firmly at wall/bed to have it doggy style for females.
  - how can soldiers even work? And having weekly or so visit to a prostitute, how much calmness/focus to do their job is gained here vs. doing it multiple times just alone.
- Of course having a (loving/caring?) partner to have sex with is just the regular thing  for social animals like humans; but what is the perfect simulation of sex with a partner when for some time being you cannot rely on one? Or no one is attracted to you...
  
- OR:
- [..] cushion-condom-selfsex is just so practical here for males as dildos for women.
** INFO more documentation about me / about everything / my realm

- he's so proud I could make it again and indebted to Ms. F
- well who is this, many ppl and so much money in me
- so just some flattering, but it's mixed of course
** WAT?! make ppl rediscover intelligence evolution by social interaction (word learning)
- social intelligence
- good to have some scholars out there who can do research "on their own"
** TODO publication about social binding theory and selfsex
- smallest common denominator of tradition and modernity
  - selfsex: necessary escape hatch to have more control over sex drive
- privacy: being away from, diving into nature of the body
  - it is not easy to be alone, it is better to know about humans as event machine
  - nature, evolution of randomnes so much better than the made stories about god
- perspective of men/women?
** WAT?! Convention of the Realm (Sansscouci)
*** Common goal / smallest common denominator / neutrality with Bacon
Not necessary and too public, better only info-hub@darknet, hardcore will never die (der harte Kern, der das alles in mir miterlebt hat)
- maybe some more secluded place is necessary, media coverage/reflection from outside the Realm is too much for this event (esp. commemorating)

Polls about parts of the plan after or at Sansscouci (how to deal with all this new knowledge civilized?)

A meeting of foes, how to really get this done?

NOT A GOAL: planning to let the world perish in war is not any longer acknowledged a valid goal, for new knowledge is around which can garuantee a harmonious society (what is hexie?)

TO WEIGH: already approaching endgame vs. the next 10.0000 years (an empire which does not crumble over time. Why do empires collapse? Overextension and loss of control (cf. Roman Empire)

A common goal:
- less burden of management (good to have some good command in world domination, but still so much troubel ahead
Capitalism was good for fast development and production cycles putting technology in our hands. (Silicon Valley, Pearl River Delta)

Free markets in a controlled capitalism...
Necessity of the devil for Bacon's theory of power (power is always used, this is why the devil, as in Hawks, evolved to dominate via e.g. influence [the doves cannot prohibit its use]
The Doves would like to aim for:
Functional humans to make society run smoother. (some kind of gold standard: to get into this state only by education; can I help here? As we know with language learning in my host, it did help.)


Widerspruch/Contradiction

Timeline and reflection about the Realm in my realm
The Realm inspecting me, getting used to my body, being comforted or discomforted with my political views. Doves and Hawks. Split and more inclusions for each party, pretty much world wide. Unity with some alternative to cleansing seems possible. I made thinking about this unity possible, so I have some command. (Not many influencers left opposing my vision/knowledge!)

getting used to my thinking and having (at least) one (god dam'it! :-) ) thought to unite all parties. Coincidence as event vs. coincidentia oppositorum (the folding of all opposites into one new seed to make progress with) as envisioned by Cusanus...
Insurance Bechterev all my life developing scar: ppl could inspect me or communicate via my head
Privacy and selfsex
General theme: coffee, sugar, dehydration, but at the beginning I could just stand up and drink my water, but I needed advise already for so unclear.
Poisened with sugar and dehydrated I became so green, almost. Interference, proof of consciousness began.
It became clear I could be a king. A real King's Quest.
Working under influence at LM Trier, Mr. Merten's library.
Rid into Hospital Mutterhaus Trier by play with Marco.
Run into void at Koblenz, fleeing from Isa via bike, my trusty.
Biting on chilli saved me from death, pressing my scar on the floor with gluten lock.
I've been given the leash to Mr. Trump, i.e. he had to play the major devil to me and he very much wanted so, continuing slavery.
Luzifer awakening with Frankfurt Rindswürstchen, Löwensenf Extrascharf and coffee. (Some impression for many, also Lisa already.)
Civil war play in me.
Contact with Marco almost cost my head.
Everyday levelling out with plating on my head without me knowing
Pandemic starting out in Wuhan with Influencers inspecting ppl about me being there?!
The time I was watching Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Be on your toes Mr. O'Brian.
Lisa already watching, but that's not really my man, until some footage shown.
Cheeselock (too much Parmesan and only Mate :/ , yes, Lisa liked the Cheesewoman at Edeka, too.)
Sleeping in my fathers chair and got better.
Advice about salad, fish, but then driven out to only meat.
Standing at the kitchen window sill smoking and listening to DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist (Survive Song).
Lured into sugar lock again with Ritter Sport. Found Lindt 99% chocolate on my way further in lock.
Still head didn't get much better, ever more ppl in my thinking hub, thinking fast, thinking principled.
Sepherin and Bechterev acknowledge the ultimate doubt about being trained in safety/risk.
(To always be SAFE, the rule #1 of the Realm. All this FEAR to be at risk/UNSAFE known in the Realm.)
To always be at RISK. How to be truely free? I had the illusion of freedom/safety/privacy, it felt like real freedom -- really important, really the almost invisible advantage of just being human, not Realm.
How do you want to live your life?
The void to give from the current generation to the next. (When Maynard got to know about the "necessity" of evil in the world [no awakening with weed was necessary like with me], he was shaken, trembling, drugs; what's left? First anger! Why the world cannot be sober? Not easy to reason with the devil, what is reason anyway, what did he know back then? Back then only possibility left: Being somehow patient about things to come. Taking comfort in the good life, but even the vineyard felt wrong sometimes. Real Lisa was of course shaken to the ground, too.)
Having an alternative to the void: Knowing about the mechanics of the body and the mind, and about relationships:
- RISK to loose control about the one's your attracted to
- utmost SAFETY by privacy, body control, rinsing
The ultimate hope of the Realm: finally possible to have reasonable citizens by getting out of sex drive ones and thinking about reflection as basic principle of the universe, "somewhat" lucky random evolution on this planet...


Met some ppl (guys and girls) in my upper realm, who really dwelled in my realm of knowledge and became +my Realm+ (good reminder of the neutrality of this newly found realm, a swarm think realm), my predicted RandomOnes. And it is our Realm, because pares inter pares by science. This is why true power is with me. So many optimizations already planned, the Plan already so perfect? :-) Still question lingering when to realize this true power.

^What was clear was that someone really had fun in privacy and this someone was called René Tobner and was looking for a muse, called Lisa Feiler.
PPL NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED TO EXPLAIN, WHAT'S GOING ON at all^, and yet difficult to understand for what could one early interpreter understand and yet expressing what he/she understood again...alas *seufz*:
Kierkegaard: To really understand means to be able to teach it (to someone), which normally involves using your "own" words ("own"? normally when paraphrasing one CAN use one's own words, plus some newly learned [+ the common words, otherwise communication is difficult]). But if you have to get to know first the words to learn the theory?
Learning another language  is impossible without the words of the foreign tongue.
Learning about everything* is impossible without the words of the foreign thought.
*The philosophical theory thereof.
So difficult:
Realigning one's already learned words, esp. when it's about human affairs like sex, love, freedom (money is some sort of freedom), and so on.
Es musste etwas auf meinem Rücken ausgetragen werden. Erst sieht's nach Gottes Werk und /Teufels Beitrag/ aus, (/Cleansing/ -- the devil needs a chance, again! The way of the Realm [until now?] --)
und das ist es auch (noch), aber dennoch steckt der Zufall, die Einsicht in die Evolution, in unsere Entstehung (Was ist der Mensch?) dahinter. Und wenn man das verstanden hat, dann ist Gottes Werk und Teufelsbeitrag nur eine Kategorie, dann kann man die Welt neutral, irgendwie unparteiisch, betrachten. Das ist die lang' vergessene Einheit der Menchen auf diesem Planeten.
The end of story telling is reached -- just for a moment -- when someone understands this neutrality. Then (panic of) boredome ensues (What if everyone is just so relaxed? And tried privacy [control of sex drive]?), but nonono we still have ourselves to confuse us* / to play with / to learn from each other (biorecord) and to do more research into the unknown. (* one human beings acquired language is -- luckily -- quite randmon, still :P )
Die Tradition setzt auf das Geheimnis der körperlichen Alignierung.
Die Moderne setzt auf die Alignierung des Geistes, die vernünftige Menschen erschafft.

REST IN PEACE to all ppl who had to be extinguished during this play for my safety and for the impossibility to inform everyone about new world order, when the same is just in the making, work in progress, and is the newly found new world order really convincing? So much doubt! Still always the distinction between power and knowledge giving orientation, and with so much knowledge I could already deliver, what would be able materialize?
Now we have the ultimate doubt of the Realm fixed and how long a war do we want to prepare for? All these scenarios... and it's still so uncertain, how or if at all will survive.
Better directions, better directors.
How much more cleansing is necessary? Depends on how fast we are with educating/training ppl!
The directors can aim better now. How to aim best? Having to play on humanity still in mind?

How to restart with so much guilty conscious by victims of war?
The necessity of the devil for Bacon's theory of power that power is always used. But knowledge can be used now, too, for we found it...

Many countries want a plan!

A future for all. It exists, but we have to unveil it.

The inner and the outer. Only one time, this planet.
Really, to start from here...
Pares inter pares vs. world peace is impossible (w/o exposing I -- so much is left of unexposed I!)
One day we all can be equals, but that's some work...
My world merged in you, and your world merged in mine.
Knowledge vs. Power
Knowledge and Power
And Power can work with better Knowledge now.
The Realm -- how to get away with murder
The insurance Bechterev syndrome is just the result poor state management.
1. Everyone's struggle for a successful life. The state of one's pride. (Wie man dasteht, vor sich selbst und vor andern. Anerkennung.)
2. I can keep safe by observing my state/body and acting accordingly.

Patriarchat
Matriarchat -- the women really MADE A STAND with I and my naive musings about stable relationships? (related to gender equality)
- being in privacy once in their life, not in need to satisfy a man
  - really means: took their own flat, womenless man everywhere
  - and you know what happened...

No matter if you're shameful or not, it's still difficult to control other persons (loved one's).

How to get away with murder/slavery?
How to get away with functional humans? The devil has no clue what I am talking about! The devil needs a chance to learn this. That's everything he will get by my rule.

Influence: good/bad effects on the world, but now with the play it kept the peace, neutrality. Some ppl had to die, yes. But it is wrong that power necessarily corrupts. Functional humans can control their powers.
So many ppl in lock, yet.

Die Gewissenprüfung und wer ist nützlich, wer nicht? (some ppl asking about "how much do you want to make me kill myself?") would really a waste of human ressources...
Wie nützlich war ich? Wozu könnte ich irgendwann nützlich sein?

The marriage is done in my mind (this strange feeling we HAD to work together -- even if it was by game mechanics -- and it def. was not only my mind. Incorporating this experience in your own mind might still feel daunting and confusing, esp. with family ties shaken. Thinking about families, and love, and sex -- and all the love and sex in my realm -- I cannot remember to have married anyone! :) Well, who is the creator of this world, it's mixed: yin and yang day and night at work forming this new world for the first time in human history. Yin is weak. Yang is strong. I am weak and I am strong. Our marriage and our merry age! :P

No real evidence for this world, only reproducable via magic hat and a host???
But wait comparing notes is indeed an evidence!
I made everything fall apart by Everything, but putting it back together is should be easier now.

Pares inter pares by science! (And even kings need some consent by their subjects ... )

- The Citadel of Ricks adopted "Sir"
- GOAL: avoiding system shock (can the human species be more content and crafty (good workers) at the same time? -- We think, we can; masters of body & mind.)
  - For avoiding *group* based human hatred, we have to answer the question "What is a human being?", in order to see, there is only *one group*.

  - I had always problems with my name René
    - ppl didn't know how to pronounce, I myself was unsure (french name in english/german context)
    - I offered my nickname "Tobi" as a token of friendship to them (as I learned with Bernd and Steffi) and of course there was some understanding that this seemed appropriate for I gifted them freedom (former slaves -- just to make this perfectly clear, how serious a matter this is for some masters, who lost their slaves)
    - So yet another name to be endangered or friendly addressed with (no matter if real world of realm)
***** @WORK unclear if we can convince the world with our plan, still...
- even dangerous to try to convince some
  - truth can make blind  (Emily Dickinson), show it slowly

  - federate :: 1814 (implied in federated), a back-formation from federation, or else from Latin foederatus "leagued, federated, combined; having a treaty, bound by treaty," past participle of foederare "to establish by treaty," from foedus "covenant, treaty, alliance" (from PIE root *bheidh- "to trust, confide, persuade"). Related: Federating. As an adjective, by 1710.
  - the treaty is the priciple of reflection and civilized behaviour (uncontrolable objects, Nussbaum -- well enough abstract principle to adopt?!!)
    - personal (body & mind) and social identity to the max

    - there is a good italian movie of Momo?
**** The "Harem" & Lisa & tricks
- the Harem vs. the cradle rockers of the child of the "Realm"
  - shame vs. helping me grow up (again)
- mostly by selfsex transmitting orgasmic energy into me which makes me unrelaxed
  - by my arousal at night face is stretched
    - most efficient arousal produced by having Lisa kick it off which, well efficient, you really know how to get to me
      - Lisa torn apart every night between hurting me and enjoying herself
        - but trick:
          - first Lisa speaking and someone else enjoying herself/himself
          - then Lisa going to sleep, letting someone else entirely do the job
      - person Y is torn apart every night between hurting loved person X and enjoying herself
      - I really am sad about this like Lisa was sad and terrified every night she had to talk or transmit selfsex energy to distort me
      - I am sad for I could physically by distortion not be happy
      - I get stronger, but how long must this continue?
      - fixpoint and crosshair for the Realm, it's really fun as long as you don't think too much about it (like I first thought it funny (clit rubbing & Lisa has to start) and was really laughing about it to Lisa "presence" here in my realm, she was not amused)
      - so now I really have a reason to be serious
      - what I write is still distorted by the devil
      - I mustn't have it to easy
        - the devil in my "game" realm vs. the devil in the Realm/world
        - some sadism in the devil's way, what to expect else?
        - really important to reflect about pain and joy and writing it down
          - for me
          - for all audience gathered in me (even the devil)
            - e.g. Transantltic Bridge had some doubts regarding eleminated soldiers, but what can I do to remedy this and still go on? Killing more ppl is really, this time we finally have answered the question, what is a human being?, not progress
            - which is in the long run imparting exactly this knowledge, which is hard to contain
            - in the short run one has to prepare for the long run
              - better do it controlled than only person2person information (which should happen inevitably
            - so we could beginn as well soon enough!
            - deconstruct and have the ultimate doubt on you in your daily life
            vs.
            - construct and have a civilization to finally be able to speak of soon
              - insight was lacking, w/o insight not the right word associations
              - at least 8000 soldiers have been eliminated, it's enough
        - jeden Tag soll ich gefährdet werden
        - etwas Politik zu Tagesbeginn
        - 2/3 mind. "meiner" Soldaten wurden ermordet?
          - konnten die Füße nicht still halten, weil halt auch teuflische/verdrehte Informationen zugespielt
          - ein Mordplan durch den Teufel in meinem Reich ausgeheckt
            - dass sich der Teufel mal auf die Vernunft einlässt, das an sich ist schon ein Wunder
          - wie mir das im Nachhinein mitteilen, das schlechte Gewissen des Teufels
            - und was kam bei den Teufeln in den oberen Rängen an?
              - Spielmechanik aber Weltpolitik wird verhandelt
                - alles was ich denke/sage vom Agenten, der gerade in Reichweite ist, weiter gegeben an die weiter oben, aber verdreht, wie stille Post
                - dieses Gibberish konnten meine Soldaten wohl von den wahrheitsgemäßen unterscheiden
                - per I und FUD meine Soldaten aufgestachelt, sodass diese dann ausgeschaltet werden "mussten"
                  - Atombombendrohung gegen Deutschland gab es ja auch schon..
                - die Überlebenden müssen sich immer noch verstecken!
                - ? cleansing (mit Vaccinen) ist immer noch geplant
                  - e.g. question of elderly
                    - euthanasy also via I of really old incapable ppl
                      - how really is incapable? Hard to say w/o objective medical perssonel
                      - medical euthanasy might be an option (as primary reason: having money inherited, wtf?!)
                      - What's the physical/psychical condition of the patient?
                        - if bad condition, can it be cured? even rinsing through is difficult..?! I know :P
                      vs
                    - jobs in elderly care
                  - austerity on us for already far too long
                  - how to reboot into a future for all?
                  - if it can be done in orderly fashion... (whom even to euthanize? how dysfunctional is the person? doctor should decide and money should not be a reason.)
                    - it should be done the orderly/civilized way
        - und dennoch ist das alles ein "Spiel"
        - naja erst schießen, dann fragen
  - coffee agent in right eye muscle can intrude deeply
- really hard: Lisa has to tell me at night, that she does not love me (the game of doubt)
  - really hurts my heart, but it's not true and I love her for I want to!
** Claude Levi-Strauss about
- researching cruelty and kindness in indigenous peoples (aborigines = Ureinwohner generell irgendwo, Tropen, Australien etc.) 
  - much more ingrained/closer than western civilizations
- "knew about I(?!), found no remedy by looking into those simple ppls' life"
  - I should think this way, def. there some new knowledge around (see Mr. Schüssler)
** WAT?! production revolution with fast thinking and controlling robots?
- in electronics production
** TODO sex & satisfaction & shame & sexual harassment
- to have this out (just like the math proof)
- almost impossible without selfsex
  - to focus even on some other person is inconvenient
  - just focussing on one's self via food, joint, selfsex as much as you want to achieve true satisfaction
    - "Energie haben und gut fühlen" -- macht die saure Gurkenzeit vergessen :-)
  - once not think about relationship problems
  - if both partners have trained selfsex, partnership is much better for:
    - less focus to please the partner, more free somehow?!!
*** Das Primat des Sozialen und die Schwierigkeit der Vereinzelung
- kulturverhaftet
- Shannon: Walt Wittman: enjoying the own body/sex [gay context, but well, just training]
- Marx: Das menschliche Tier kann sich nur im Sozialen vereinzeln.
  - ? Wie gut kann die Vereinzelung im Sozialen gelingen?
  - eine Entfremdung von unserem Körper findet im sozialen Kontext immer statt
    - Aufmerksamkeit immer auch beim andern und nicht nur bei sich selbst
    - das Primat des eigenen Denkens (jeder schiebt seinen eigenen Film?) verhindert Konzentration auf eigenen Körper
      - was sollte denn auch noch sein? Das ist so viel! (was befriedigt werden möchte)
  - zur Annäherung an unseren Körper wird Privatheit und Selfsex empfohlen
*** Scham
**** shaming among men
- Warum gibt's eigentlich keine Arzt speziell für Männer?
  - Frauenarzt berät hinsichtlich Geburt, Sexualität
  - Kann ich mit Frau Grüner darüber sprechen?
  - Kann ich überhaupt mit jemand über Selfsex sprechen?
    - genügend gute Gründe habe ich jetzt!
*** sexual harassment/abuse
- mitigated by selfsex
** TODO How to start conversation with R-ppl?
- "so viel Ungemach über das Reich gebracht"
  - I have brought so much misfortune over the R. But if you're willing to let me explain for a while, I think this misfortune can be transformed into some fortune for you and the ppl around you...
  - why so serious? Isn't there a neutral way?
    - so many jaw drops, what's possible?

** TODO children's story about what has happened to me / the R / the world
- like Gulliver's Travels with my experience of the/my Realm
** TODO my knowledge vs. me
- it's my knowledge which needs to decided upon, not me (after all I could be endangered by mighty ppl like Mr. T after this myself endangering event, in which he was the Black Emperor)
** TODO intelligence evolution by being trained on this planet / describing The Unfolding
- dictionary of reason (as opposed to dict. of devil with all it's delusion, but also based on contradiction..)
  - fruitful reflection with Mr. Trump -- the emperor devil in this play still weighing heavily on me...
- no need for a god (-> but social principle and reflection as absolute axiom)
- ex: humans talking about the interesting phaenomena, like the first self-made fire (flintstone) -> our personal intelligence can be seen as a social one developing over ages long forgotten, but we had to evolve together anyway
- in essence: all by random...
- original dualism of every planet, where life can develop fast: relatively balanced day and night cycle
- primary left or right hand (probably not): is this trained? observation in children
  - social intelligence and when I reflect about foreign thought: consent produces balance w/ agent (energy moving to the right), is this different w/ left-primary-hand ppl? explanation for initial *disagreement*? probably too much, maybe it's just developed language nat. lang?
*** intelligence vs. quick-think (alignment) / reasonable content vs. machinery
- being intelligent (inter-lego, etw. dazwischen legen): having understanding via words about my current world to get by
- quick thinking is just liquid in the head, but what to do with this speed?
*** hair and gender
- are males evolutionary prone to have more hair than women?
  - women less hair for mothers breast feeding their children would be more difficult with hairs (cf. http://theconversation.com/why-do-women-have-less-body-hair-than-men-4733)
** TODO monogamy vs. polygamy / monogyny vs. polygyny
- Mr. C M and his Ms. pondering this
- really don't know if these two
- patchwork families?
- maybe ppl asking about this should go into privacy first!? :-)
  - what do you really want, your freedom or...
- do you want your partner to be happy? if you're discussing this topic, it might be an indication of unhappiness...
** TODO Reflexion
- eine neutrale Sichtweise/Aspekt, die von Gut und Böse (z.B.) absieht/abstrahiert
*** Warum so schwer zu verstehen?
- wenn aligniert und Macht über andere, dann ist es einem egal, dass der Zufall ein Aspekt unseres Werdens ist -- man ist einfach so verankert in seiner Machtposition
- wenn unaligniert und ohnmächtig, dann Aspekt des Zufalls sehr heilend, weil man sich dadurch von der eigenen (Zufalls-)Biographie loslösen kann (ironisch, kontrafaktischer Abstand)
*** @WORK reflection in FP (functional programming) as identity
- struggling with reflection theory compared to struggling with learning Haskell
- the good thing: since reflection is everywhere we can find it in Haskell (or any Programming Language (PL))
- any PL has functions, functions (in the broad sense) encapsulate some action or computation
- in Haskell every function has to have a RETURN VALUE, for this is the mathematical definition of a function and Haskell was developed by mathematicians
  - why would you want to give a parameter (=INPUT VALUE) to function and get nothing back? (often it makes sense, but for now we only deal "mathy" functions)
  - f(x) = x + 2
  - f(2) => 4 -- for 2 we get 4
  - 2 and 4 are natural numbers (0,1,2,3,...) as opposed to fraction for example (one-third, etc)
  - now imagine we had function who cannot only deal with numbers but also with, say, words of our daily lanuage (the general type of words is strings [Zeichenketten], we are dealing with computers here, and we cannot easily teach a computer our words, you need machine learning and whatnot for this):
    - say_hello_to (name) = "Hello " + name
    - say_hello_to ("Samuel") => "Hello Samuel"
  - now we have nat. numbers and words as different TYPES of (input/output) values
    - type of f is: Nat -> Nat
    - type of say_hello_to is: String -> String
  - now what is reflection in Haskell? it's just the most general function of all:
    - identity (x) = x
    - to express that we can give any argument of any type to this function we need type variables
    - so the type of identity or short id is: a -> a
      - at ghci try:
        :t(ype) id
        => id :: t -> t
    - and this seems to be like our thinking, reflecting about object X in your head, and handling this thought somehow with your mental capacity (logic and memory)
    - to compute naturally, Haskell has lazy evaluation, which ist totally not the standard in other PLs
    - math and our thinking, just the beginnings of understanding... 
  
  some more about types
  - TYPES are functions themselves that can take arguments; to have a name for the types of type-functions the term /kind/ is used
    - in Haskell repl: :k(ind) /Typename/
      - => some with stars/asterisks
    - in Idris   repl: :k(ind) /Typename/
      - => more than stars (you have to BUILD this abstraction using a simpler language, which is Haskell in this case)
    - in general: for the elements of a category there is always another category; in Haskell the first 3 levels are: type, kind, and sort; of course this could go on, but how many levels of categories do we need? Depends on deep/shallow ends. And it gets tedious to find a name for something general occuring over and over again.

    - i.e. our cultural evolution, what makes us human!
    - cultural evol. vs. natural one
- ONE CYCLE, ONE THOUGHT (sequential, concept of event machine from programing languages PL makes sense, i.e. node.js event loop): what do we do with it?
  - constructing coherent "picture" of the world we peceive
  - memory of coherent thoughts we do not doubt (how to we commit information to our memory? how is it encoded? Does Church encoding play a role?)
  - memory of thoughts we do doubt (plus: undecidable ones, anyway: non associative to valid facts collected)
    - makes our thinking slower by making us inclined to revalidate already established coherent facts (to keep our world view intact/coherent)
  - PANDORA'S BOX:
    - free -- but mechanical -- will of the human machine :: adding new ideas to our set of coherent thoughts / our valid personal record
    - some (un-)safety in big picture: random evolution on this planet, social intelligence, an ABIOGRAPHICAL record we miss most of the time

** @WORK Die Nischen der kulturellen Evolution
- die Kultur, die es verdirbt, aber auch so viel reicher, chaotischer macht (mehr Entropie) / Warum ging es mir so schlecht? Keine Alignierung, keine Sicherheit, nur ein vages Gefühl von Liebe
- die Kultur hats dann doch gerettet, die vielen Gigantinnen und Giganten, auf die ich bauen konnte
  - kultur (n.) :: 1924, originally, "ideals of civilization as conceived by the Germans," a word from the First World War and in English always at first ironic, form German /Kultur/, form /Latin/ cultura
- soviel Kulturerbauung nun im Reich erfahren (das Wir wurde gedacht - mein Ich hat inspiriert)

** DONE The ultimate doubt/unity of the R
Everyone who doesn't know about Influence has just the illusion of controlling his fate. To be played with or to direct a play (and even sometimes directors are not completely sure they are safe, just being outside can be dangerouse, getting a silent spy agent on you is a pretty high risk.

To always be SAFE, the rule #1. All this FEAR to be at risk/UNSAFE known in the Realm. -- The ultimate doubt of the Realm -- no real innocence (childlike simplicity)/peace with oneself is possible when trained about this doubt, torn apart by day to day training oscillating between safety and risk/endangerment). To see this doubt / to reflect upon this training, is the first step for the Realm to make progress.

With this knowledge, knowing how doubt is something we suffer from. To not doubt is healing from our up until now imperfect culture. How to be efficient for yourself is no problem without doubt about possibility, but to implement this thinking with each and everyone in the world is again too much for now. Yet, to have to swarm in me be in the world is the real goal.


What is power over knowledge? Just logic? Having judgements?
