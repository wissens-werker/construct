#+TODO: TODO @WORK RÜCKFRAGE WAT?! | DONE INFO WAITING
#+STARTUP: indent
#+TITLE: world-wide wished for things
* TODO Maintaining/improving this file with others
- work will be done with Gitlab software, awaiting neutral server and replicatable setup (it must be done safely, only relying on Github or similar services is not enough)
- one mirror for now: https://gitlab.com/wissens-werker/construct
  - not safe enough, too (replicated setup of maintainers, issues etc.), just for now to spread responsibility
* TODO IN GENERAL: a functional state for functional citizens
- world-wide poltical agenda: native sustainable workers of a sustainable capitalistic economy, i.e. not going bankrupt every 10-20 years or so
  mixture of Amsterdam / Singapore / Luxemburg?
  
  1. ending Corona/Covid somehow for having employment/trade again flourishing
     - an alternative to austerity getting around the problem of lazy workers
       - more shifts, more ppl, more money: enough incentive for workers
     - supply chain and employment optimization via digital infrastructure managed by scientists, employers (and unions? = employees might do it themselves now)
       - maybe there even is some algorithm for optimizing all this?
       - machine learning
  2. investment into (via WTO etc.)
     - countries delivering workers to some other country (e.g. Poland to Germany)
  3. just go on as usual with foreign work force, but some betterment of salary for all
     - workers who feel the urge to return in their home countries should have enough incentive to do so (by 1.)
  4. refugees/oppressed -- for too much pressure on Europe
     - strong countries (esp. USA) need to give some more freedom to weaker ones
       - nationstates for Palestines and Kurds
         - Israel and Turkey can arrange for that in due time
       - end of war esp. in Syria, Yemen via additional troups (more investment in United Nations army, NATO needs to be more neutral)
         - Mr. Assad has some good command?!
         - Yemen as neutral as possible (w/o Saudi-Arabia having too much to say)
       - other peoples under distress
         - ex-Jugoslavia: maybe reunion possible?
         - Krim? should be ok to stay with Russia
  5. digital infrastructure
     - blockchain for the world to inspect and control economic differences of the nations and to finally have some good grasp on managing volatility of markets
     - fiber/5G
     - ...
  6. the end of all philosophy: ultimate wisdom reached: possibility to empower humans with reasonable thinking in every aspect (What is god? Who is our creator?)
     ? to have real functional humans:
     - knowledge about reflection (e.g. human event machine, no god) => quick think w/o doubts
       - empowering thinking and body via natural means and a culture of cooperation (modernity) vs. oppressing body and thought via artificial means (tradition)
         - privacy is necessary for mastery of body, full capacity of the mind
           - can ppl stay reasonable? the decision (Readme.org) vs. criticism ending in violence
* INFO public infrastructure vs. private business / both necessary
- freedom of browsers vs. monetization
  - via ads (adblockers pain in the ass for enterprises promoting some product)
  - media -> drm? (digital rights management)
- Mr. Stallmann, Mr. Torvalds vs. many entrepreneurs
  - all the licences
  - to find a way for the free market
It's better when it's free. Regarding sex def., but still ppl want to have a product to sell...
private vs. public tools production [economy/Ökonomie]
* INFO functionally employing ppl vs. automatization/robotics (pretty much [far] away future)
- regular workers vs. functional workers by reason (how much laziness is an issue?)
- more shifts, more ppl in work, 12 EUR proposal (in Germany by SPD) as minimum wage already means a lot, but with more shifts and less hours it's very probably not enough
  - time employment agencies really do not help
    - flexible employment of workers without temp agencies?
- what is behind the scenes:
  - we need a means to exchange goods
    - money with inner worth : Bitcoin (a new gold standard)
    - fiat money (since gold standard was abandoned -- Bretton Woods):
      - any regular national currency on this planet
      - creation ex nihilo since Bretton Woods ever more
    - the "play" about the money must continue to have day to day trust in our future / to sustain ourselves with goods (Waren: Haus, Auto, Lebensmittel)
- good parenting should be possible (time for job vs. time for family)
* INFO crime / "slave" businesses
Just a reminder of corruption in society (Menschenhandel, human trafficking, corruption of police -- all this is possible in dark corners of society)
* TODO unemployment management / guarding against poverty / smooth economy
- banks have a duty to uphold real econmy (among other things)
  - bitcoin may be a gold standard (it is by technical means and also by ppl having trust in it, but will others allow it?), but distribution of wealth and stability might be at odds sometimes
- parity with employed workers regarding Christmas bonus (end-of-year bonus)
- auf der Schwelle zum neuen Jahr, Konjunktur ankurbeln (to reflate the market at the doorstep to the new year)
- Why Zeitarbeitsfirmen if unemployment agency can deal with it?
** WORKING HOURS
*** example
- ALDI had a poll extending opening times LIDL-like (until 22pm) and ALDI workers denied this (stayed with 20pm)
- Another solution might be more working shifts.
* TODO reform health system world-wide / as efficient as possible
- Rinsing/Durchspülen already standard...
- my body, my choice -- completely at odds with prostitution (free or unfree), abortion denial (Poland)
- this should explain betterment of ppl
- get rid of COBOL (an about 61 year old PL)?
  - https://logicmag.io/care/built-to-last/
    - "IBM’s latest, fastest “Z” series of mainframes have COBOL support as a key feature"
  - COBOLs reads pretty much like natural language, BUT STILL:
    - HOW MANY MANAGERS (NON-PROGRAMMERS) HAVE A LOOK AT COBOL CODE?
    - issues of code correctness, way less type safety
  - transpiling if necessary... (i.e. Haskell DSL to COBOL)
- making functional ppl exposing alignment and awakening in privacy (real alignment impossible w/o this kind of autogenous training)
- aligning by dancing (cf. China, Wuhan experiment)
- coffee shops in order to be able to lear about your body in privacy (being your own doctor)
** INFO China proud again (Wuhan: so much progress)
** RÜCKFRAGE How much cancer is related to psychic condition? (being fearful about becoming ill?)
- natural relegion helps to eradicte this fear completely
* TODO e-government / efficient bureaucracy
- really easy to create a company (cf. England's SME [small-medium-enterprises], Germany's Ich-AG)
  - easier paperwork
  - having skilled ppl (England: north-south-gap)
  - cf. theconversation.com SME bedrock british econommy, gov.uk Local Industrial Strategies (2018)
- e-government tooling from Estonia, Sweden!!! (so much Open/Free Software available already)
* @WORK more (green) energy
** solar power from Africa or even souther Europe
- Australia is delivering sun energy to Singapore by 2027 (Sun Cable)
  - direct current submarine cable tech
- too much political trouble in Norther Africa right now, but South Europe?
- Sub-Sahara (Kenia, Namibia?) has even better sun power than Northern Africa
  - some sun panels already there, but lacking infrastructure (bringing it to the ppl)
** progess with fusion reactors?
- arirang.com
** hydrogen energy for factories and trucks / not that good for (personal) cars?
* @WORK economic kybernetics/supply chain optimization with free market of course
es muss immer IRGENDWAS ausgehandelt werden in den einzelnen Märkten, in Staaten, in Unternehmen (Lohn, Arbeitszeiten, value of a currency)
Sachen, die nicht ausgehandelt werden müssen:
Urlaub (ja der Staat macht das einfach! gesetzl. Regelungen..)

Schritt für Schritt Abstimmung in diesen Märkten / Tezos Blockchain und die Protokollaushandlung
EIN NETZ VON NETZEN / einzelne Unternehmen bis hin zur globalen Weltwirtschaft
jeder ist irgendwo Teil eines Netzes
die einzelnen Netzen versuchen von zentraler Stelle aus zu optimieren, aber Verhandlungen auch innerhalb der einzelnen Netze
Firmen haben Macht über ihre eigene Verwaltung (Blockchain etc. in Firma, daher schwierig dort jetzt auch überall Tezos zu etablieren) -- Zahlen aber zur Wirtschaftskontrolle nach außen liefern..
Öffentliche Hand sollte aber mal alles mit Tezos machen ; hier die Aushandlung zwischen Arbeitgeber und Arbeitnehmer perfekt machen (als Demonstration auch für die freie Wirtschaft)
Aushandlung sollte abgebildet werden in der Datenstruktur; andernfalls eine systemische Schwäche, die uns spätestens seit der Industrialisierung zu schaffen macht (Arbeitgeber overpowering Arbeitnehmer until Arbeitnehmer storm the factory, and rinse and repeat)
Wir können einfach nicht diesen Fehler immer wieder machen, so viele Neutrale/Unparteiische, die dieses Problem sehen. Und wie überhaupt nochmal neu anfangen, wenn nicht mit der richtigen Architektur...
Politik gibt's ja auch noch für die Unternehmen... Wirtschaftsregulation

irgendwie muss Leistung belohnt werden ;
Meritokratie und Technokratie hand in hand

** to have ONE OPEN SOURCE PRODUCT ready for markets in companies and state economy planning? covering all the use cases?
** TODO each country having control over its currency's value
- to only rely on Bitcoin/btc is too much?!
- currently Europe's Euro model just sharpens economic imbalances between member states, for weak economic power of one country cannot be balanced by decreasing one state's own currency value
  - maybe it still makes sense to keep Euro, for each country euro country managed on blockchain weights can be applied???
    - also some trust in each countrie's currency? and still only digital? printing money and minting coins too much of a hassle?!
    - still getting rid of paper money like in Singapore and China seems to be worthwhile
    - a common ledger -- different currencies to level differences in economic power
- some experts to consult: Yannis Varoufakis, Alexis Tsipras, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Giorgos Papandreou (Athens), James Galbraith (Texas)
  - A modest proposal for solving the Eurozone Crisis, Version 4.0
** Internet of things @ blockchain + 5G fast everywhere could be really helpful
- huge quarrel between USA and China
  - mostly about market share?
  - but also espionage (more open source could help here) or only red herring argument?
- can't we have 5g open source infrastructure (have to look up what's it about)
  - China/Huawei is already principal planner in ITU (Internat. Telecomm. Union)
** TODO consensus algorithms
- having a copy of sth. uniquely produced, those receiving the copy can make consensus
- cf. zero knowledge proof
** ethereum
** tezos
** business management for everyone; connection to blockchain
- SAP: more blockchain in Enterprise-Resource-Planning for the plan
  - makes really sense with this huge market share!!!
- open source candidate?
** more local production to avoid mono cultures, having more organic food
- maybe more ppl like to work in agriculture again?
- happy farmers
- less feeding the world
- how much meat is necessary? still (organic) meat nice to have!
** cardano?!
** Kantorovich/linear programming
- https://chris-said.io/2016/05/11/optimizing-things-in-the-ussr/
- There are hierarchical levels to the "economy" and central planning may work well at some levels. Companies at the lower levels of the hiearchy are centrally planned entities with managers assigning tasks to employees instead of using a free market to distribute them within the organization. At the middle layer, the free market links these centrally planned companies and force them to compete. It's an open question whether having a centrally planned top layer to handle national economic strategy and steer market forces is better than letting the free market handle that as well.
** TODO linear types and prototype objects
- on a blockchain
- dynamic and type-safe programming?!
  - linear types for efficient memory allocation!!!!
  - for mixins in OO?!
- dashes, greater-than in function names (works with QWERTY, too! :-) )
- a concatenative language is a functional one and trivial to run efficiently
  - evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html
  - like Factor/Joy; function composition by default (not dot operator like in Haskell)
** INFO various enterprises experimenting w/ hyperledger (permissioned blockchain)
- ALDI, LIDL und Schwartz
- interfaces/Schnittstellen
* WAT?! internet capable to deal with ever more traffic?
- Zoom et al. in Corona times def. a stress test
- state of the art of internet backbone? Huawei vs. Juniper (autonomous/self-driving networks?)
- related: how good connection bandwidth? fiber to the home investment!!
* education
** digital classroom
- HPI Schul-cloud
** TODO sexual education
*** exploring privacy (selfsex, awareness of the body, automatic healing by satisfaction [food, THC, music, sex, sleep, symmetric training])
- many mighty ppl think it should be a secret!
- meine tausend kleinen Tode und wieder mal ein großer Tod bereitet, ja naja... war wohl nix!
- der Natur wieder zu vertrauen, was kann das heißen?
  - sich selbst vertrauen können, weil man seinen Sexualtrieb unter Kontrolle hat!
- Geheimnis der Gesundheit
  - informing ppl about this health practice might be too hard to grasp
    - RECOMMENDED to wait for concerted effort (school, textbooks etc.)
- Was ist der Mensch? Was ist die Intelligenz eines Menschen?
  - Intelligenz vs. Wissen? [Event-Machine]
- linke Hand vor Gesicht fokussieren, etwas zum Zielen haben, linke Hand Aktivierung per Fokus stärkt linke Seite; zum Ausbalancieren ausgezeichnet
- We are so tightly bound by our social context, that it's really hard to find one's self.
  - to alleviate/mitigate/ease (ger. /lindern/) relationship-stress (you might experience) being alone at least once in your life is advised
  - to be really independent from other persons and interpersonal sex drive (once in your life at least)
    - for we are so much entangled in our day to day culture, confusing words, confusing opinions, it is so hard to be really alone
  - concentrate on your health, your own nature only
  - achieve relaxed best form of body and mind (mind = only reflection as attraction or detraction to concepts you have internalized)
  - being more relaxed in any kind of relationship, be it just for pleasure or parenting
- We are so tightly bound by confusing concepts, that it's really hard to find one's self.
  - Does god exists? If not or unlikely, what remains of all this misery?
**** feeling your body / autogenic training
- feeling pain and pressing the other side
**** evolutionary big picture (social intelligence) vs. your own life
- TODO cf. MoB
- seeing oneself as a result of evolution, random development of animals on earth with humans as a kind of animal developing very sophisticated languages, instead of being only your biographical record of family, friends, and foes
  - Isn't this redemption for free?
  - Is this enough to deal with bad conscience? E.g. murder?
- how did humanity and its intelligence evolve on this planet?
  - just communication about interesting phaenomena, e.g. the first man made fire using a flintstone replicating the fire cast by thunderbolt on some dry wood (maybe even your own humble hud?)
  - but still a flintstone able to reproduce the power of nature
  - i.e. something interesting to talk about
  - interesting first words to speak about
  - our intelligence/knowledge is just the result of social interaction (knowledge not communicated is lost knowledge)
**** social principle
- TODO cf.

*** sexual preference by training / one may assume metrosexuality as norm
[edit] natural standard (hetero) vs. cultural standard (metro)
- sexual preference is established by being trained in social context
  - being gay or lesbian is just by training
  - experience about this training related by the queer community
  - shaming plays big role when ppl are trained on each other
    - peer pressure about having first intercourse leads to finding a mate as fast as possible ("Did you already pop the cherry?")
      - first intercourse with cousins or even among siblings also not uncommon
        
  - hetero sexuality seems to be the NATURAL STANDARD (there are exceptions like having neutral or both sexes in members of a species?)
  - the CULTURAL STANDARD should be metrosexuality for if you know sex preference is by random and trained, why not decide for yourself whom to fuck!
    
  - metrosexuality is the new standard perspective regarding gender preference! metrosexuality = metropolitan sexuality = in big cities more freedom of choice regarding preference of gender of your sexual partners developed first, so just for the lack of a better term for this behaviour, "metrosexuality" still applies universally, although we know the term itself referencing only big/capital cities is plainly wrong (relying on etymology for explaining specific terms might be daunting...)
  - standard of metrosexuality does not imply paedophilia (endangering the free will of the child is a bad practice, again endangering future relationships of the child TODO)
*** RÜCKFRAGE gender differences
**** female
- clitoris :: The antomist Mateo Renaldo Colombo (1516-1559), professor at Padua, claimed to have discovered it ("/De re anatomica/",[unsic!] 1559, p. 243). He called it /amor Venris, vel dulcedo/ "the love or sweetness of Venus.[sic?!]" It had been know earlier to women. (That's just another claim, of horse! :-) )
*** INFO gender equality
- <2020-12-07 Mo> dream about christmas-sugar-testing (☑) and trouser-testing (no checkmark), regarding the last I was preferring close-to-skin trousers althoug I said earlier that this is too much to observe in general for sex drive is just so difficult to overlook
  - still in the context of being with my wife in a club/cafe meeting with friends I just don't know
  - but in professional context (at work like on a spaceship) how much sexiness can you endure and still be faithful to your spouse? Are Star Trek's dresses too sexy to be professional? I don't know.
  - Should I tell her what to dress for some given social context X. I don't know. Rather not.
  - Women think a lot about this as well as men, some times less, some times more...
  - gist: How much exertion of control over the loved object/person is necessary? As few as possible, in order to preserve freedom. (maybe it's possible to express uneasiness about choice of dress, just some expression of doubting, thinking, envy (somewhat positive envy: as a token of you being bound to your mate via attraction, what can of course exploited by others, the fear of your mate being lured into unfaithfulness; this is just hard to get rid off with an attractive mate...)
*** WAT?! Onanism / self-sex
It should be ok to explore you're own sexuality with appropriate tools for various reasons:
- feeling unattractive
  - how to feel attractive w/o having sex? Having sex usually makes you "sexier"! (but also bad experience possible which result in just opposite -- still bodily activity (like any kind of sport) should result more attractivity
    - but: body/mind problem and experiencing sex
    - if privacy established only positive experience should remain, because you're very reassured of your self
      - circular reasoning to onanism again
  - having sex usually makes one more attractive because you're body is activated to the utmost [cf. runner's high]

- pressure of first intercourse (which sometimes might be even marriage)
  - women and loosing their virginity: Is clit-rubbing ok esp. before first intercourse? (Thanks for this direct question!)
    -> If it is ok for men to dash one's doodle, why not the analogue practice for women?

- men masturbating
  - Getting blind masturbating seems very unlikely, however it might be bad for alignment, if you do it only with one hand always. You should train both hands!
  - for the perfect simulation of sex:
    - to have moldable material (some kind of thick blanket) to produce a comfortable hole to fuck into,
    - using a condome -- to not hurt the penis.

Nonetheless, the human being can only really find oneself in the social realm. Without social contact, what includes sexual intercourse, we never would have survived in the first place.

more reasons for self sex
- really independent from other persons, interpersonal sex drive (once in your life at least)
  - for we are so much entangled in our day to day culture, confusing words, confusing opinions, it is so hard to be really alone
- concentrate on your health, your own nature only
- achieve relaxed best form of body and mind (mind = only reflection as attraction or detraction to concepts you have internalized)
- being more relaxed in any kind of relationship, be it just for pleasure or parenting
- solution to burden of interpersonal shaming because of having interpersonal sex or not is one instance of group based human hatred (hatred and shaming are very much related)
- why force anyone to have sex with you if you can do it and (potentially) enjoy it way more -> ruling out paedophilia (endangering the freedom (biographical free will) of the child)
*** sexual perversions
**** paedophilia
- paedophilia in families = incest
- literally: kin-lying
- examples showing how hard it is to refrain from sexual contact, esp. when you're already so close to someone as in family relations, also dissatisfaction with actual partner plays a major role:
  - parents break up (one possibly moves out), one of the parents trys to console child might end in sexual activity (why not with his partner, i.e. wife/husband ?)
  - (step-)fathers engaging with children (why not with his partner, i.e. wife/husband ?)
- to avoid: having stable partnerships, also:
  - self-sex (cushion-condom, dildo): why force anyone to have sex with you if you can do it and (potentially) enjoy it way more -> ruling out paedophilia (endangering the freedom (biographical free will) of the child)
* @WORK clash of cultures vs. integration of cultures / cultural religions vs. one natural religion
- natural big picture (evolution) vs. cultural big picture (natural religion, reasonable politics)
- not easy to make integration happen with all the different emerged aspects of cultural life, among these religion is a major obstruction for integration
- journals mocking religions might be either
  - a useful act of criticism exposing defects of religions as in:
    - preachers of hate boosting inter-religious, inter-cultural war ideas ("we are the oppressed, we need to defend, so please go to training camp in middle east and learn to fight!")
    - rather unreflected sex education in the light of 21st century/secularization/gender thinking)
  - really making the sitation worse and hardening the frontiers as in
    - Charlie Hebdo bombing, thereupon worlds stands united with "civilization/reason", but still neglecting integration
- but the real problem are cultural religions themselves for they rely on:
  - some prophet X and his interpreters making up rules for all
- so, is there a natural religion we all could consent to?
  - yes, we only need to know about the origin of our species and abstract (get rid) whereby of all cultural distinctions
  - this is possible by thinking about our:
    - random evolution on this planet
    - evolved social intelligence as opposed to only personal intelligence (what you know is just trained into you by society, but still you very much know your own history. Just both would be important to have this natural religion.)
    - What's in your mind anyway?
      - if there is nothing to be afraid of in your mind nor to hope for (no devil/no god), what's actually going on in the mind, what can we rely on? Just reflecting the world and building concepts in our mind in order to have an effect on the world, to survive, to reproduce, to engage with others, to learn words from others to share them again with others, to build communities, to destroy others, i.e. to mediate, to fight... and now we are here in the 21st century. big picture of evolution vs. personal biography of family, friends, foes
      - to see that you're nothing else than an animal which has with other animals developed interesting words to speak about (social intelligence instead of this rather personal notion we acquire)
      - personal intelligence emerges out of social intelligence/communication (flintstone making fire, something really interesting to talk about?!)
      - to find out about the cultivation of intelligence happens exactly one time on any planet in the universe exhibiting life forms (assuming the life forms will not go extinct by some interior/exterior misfortune [war/meteor-shower])

* TODO pension planning:
    - why necessary to have ppl plan so much for themselves about retirement? Why can't the state effectively provide this service?
    - better family structures to provide for elderly?
      - might be difficult but retirement homes are quite a horror most of the time...
        - family schemes of Italy might be a good example here?!
* TODO reforming law
- just new law written in English
- too much: Grammatical Framework / Raanta
  - have one abstract formulation for a law and have multiple representations in different languages all abiding this abstract one
  - a programming language (PL) to describe natural language(s) to have a precise formulation which can be used at court
  - this PL based on lambda calculus and is dependently typed, which means it's very expressive and consitency of laws is machine checkable
  - there really some effort to encode all this (also for the different nat. languages), but the key point is still to have consistency (hopefully less lawyers / law bureaucracy needed to manage laws)
